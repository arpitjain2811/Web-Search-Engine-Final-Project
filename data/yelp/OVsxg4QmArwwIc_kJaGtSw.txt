Its holiday time and that means a trip to Hallmark..cuz when you care enough.. LOL Well this location is perfect for me since its so close to home. I had never been here either. I always ended up at the one in the District. They have a great selection of ornaments and of course I found some. As well as cards & wrap. I did have to juggle my things around the store for a few until a salesperson offered to take my load up to the front. That gets  minus star..they should be paying better attention. I did end up spending 60 bucks! LOL Until next year Hallmark...

A card costs how much? Upwards of $7-$8 were on the high end of the scale. For any special occasion Hallmark has the exact sentiment printed. I just don't get how paper could cost so much. I am a windbag that loves to write my own messages into cards and they are no cheaper. The average cost of cards are somewhere around $4. I sometimes wonder if people even keep the card. For something that gets tossed aside for the gift, I feel like I am getting fleeced.  Besides cards, they carry stuffed animals, decorative wine glasses, wrapping paper, gift bags, and other trinkets.
