We are retired and have gone to this McDonald's since they built it two blocks from our house.  This last year it has gone down hill.  They are out of things often, week after week.   The service has become poor.  Some of the long time employees are good but the bad now outweighs the good at that location. The street people hitting you up in the drive through and inside but the managers will do nothing about them.  Talked to the owner and he said he would see thing get better but they did not.   After all these years we decided we no longer need McDonald's and have not been in three months.  We have ten grandkids that are not missing it either.  Poor service has cost them a lot when you think about it over the years.

My mom and I went here for sodas around the night I moved back, they tasted normal. My husband and I got sodas this morning and I cant even describe how awful they tasted! We promptly threw them out and went somewhere else. On top of that the panhandlers and drug addicts asking for money (both times) is ridiculous. Plus, we could barely understand the lady talking through the order box in the drive through. Don't go here!

I stopped by for a quick lunch and it took twenty minutes to get my order and was only spoken to in Spanish
