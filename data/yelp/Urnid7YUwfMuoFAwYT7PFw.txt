Fantastic service and knowledgeable staff! Repairs and sells all sorts of light fixtures and accessories (old and new) -great place to find replacement glass for ceiling fans! You should stop by and look around -it's a cool old shop. I heard this place is where New Orleans sent its large historical chandeliers and light fixtures to be fixed after Hurricane Katrina.

Very helpful! They've done great, inexpensive repairs for us, and once walked us through a repair over the phone. Old school, but in the best sense.
