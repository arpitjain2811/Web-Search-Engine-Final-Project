Joy is a sort of independent Urban Outfitters but the more and more I visit I realise that the items here aren't as good quality and are the very same price, there aren't really and real bargains to be had here. I saw a nice sailor type dress here the other day but it was really worth the Â£50 price tag so I left empty handed. There are various Joy shops dotted around the UK and there's another one in Edinburgh in Princes Mall, there used to be one in Glasgow but it shut down a few years ago but all the stock was left there exactly how it had been during trading which was a little bit eerie walking past the same window display as it was left like a ghost shop for months and month... and months. They do have some nice clothes though and some quirky tops. They also have some silly gifts such as false moustaches and such. I adore the layout of this shop and they even have polka dot umbrellas hanging from the ceiling - how cool! It's a nice, brightly lit shop that is very well organised and the fabulous layout makes it very inviting indeed.
