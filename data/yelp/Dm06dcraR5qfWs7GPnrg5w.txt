They are very reasonable in cost and performed the work without a hitch and went as far as doing all the little things that really weren't part of the job but made the project complete like extra brackets and covers and stuff. Had all the right tools was friendly and professional. What can I say I found a good electrician in Vegas. I took off one star cause they don't always answer their office phone but hey its a small business so its understandable if they are doing lots of jobs.

Access Electric was very reasonable and quick to respond. Called on Thursday evening arrived on Friday. I would highly recommend them to any business.

I have had Access at my house now three different times.  Two times to hang flat screen tv's on the wall and recently to fix a defective/ broken GFI switch.   They are always on time and professional and if you deal with Chris Church, he is the best, he always calls right back or texts you back right away. Great service, reasonable prices.  Highly recommend Access Electric and ask for Chris when you can :) as he is so nice to deal with.
