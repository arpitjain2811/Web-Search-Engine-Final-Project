My six year old, first grader has been attending this Karate for Kids for four months now.  He loves it.  He has become more confident.  While I was concerned about his behavior as one of the youngest in his class, he has excelled.  At his first belt testing, where I thought it would be restless, he was spirited and the instructor asked him to be in leadership class.  They had several classes focusing on stranger danger and how to handle themselves.  They taught the kids the best ways to avoid being abducted.  I can't say enough nice things about Mr. and Mrs. Dillow.  I think they are doing an excellent job!
