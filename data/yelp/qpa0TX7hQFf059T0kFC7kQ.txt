Doooooiiiive!  Great place to belly up next to bikers/tweakers/truck drivers.  But I digress, who am I to judge?

Oof.  Amber's in ain't no joke, it's a dive if I've ever seen one.  I've been here twice and both times and it was a buzz kill.  The drinks are cheap and the service was okay but it was a boring place without any appeal.
