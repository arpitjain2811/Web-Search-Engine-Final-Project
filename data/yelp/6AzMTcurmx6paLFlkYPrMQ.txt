Clouded judgment on the way home from a night out led me here.  I had a giftcard. so I figured why not?   A couple hours later I had a conversation with "Ralph" on the big porcelain telephone  that gave a couple answers to "why not". Ugh.  Maybe I deserved to be punished.

The worst Jack in the Box I have EVER BEEN TO!!! They constantly get your order wrong, the food is literally dropping with grease so badly that the bag is completely soaked!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!!!

Honestly, one star is still to good of a rating for this location! If you love burnt food, atrocious customer serivce, and long wait times then this location is perfect for you.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!
