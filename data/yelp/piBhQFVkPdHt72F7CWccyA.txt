I highly recommend Taren to cut and style your hair.  I went to her for over a year when she lived in Idaho Falls, ID.  I love the products she used on my hair for coloring and highlighting.  My hair is fine and it never dried out.  Taren is very talented and she makes you feel special as she takes care of you.

Taren rescued my hair from a botched color and cut years ago. Blonds have more fun!  She always made my hair look more stylish, yet natural.
