So the gym is made up of cardio machines, which is great. But no weights.  Very bummed to find not even a rack of free weights.  Clean towels, friendly staff.

This isn't the Cardio Center, which is included in your "complimentary" stay at the hotel, this the $25 additional a day gym that is located in the Spa.  If you want to keep up your work outs while traveling, this is totally worth it.  The machines are top of the line, enough of them that even at busy 6 a.m. executive work out time, you'll be free to find something open.  Clean, two kinds of fresh ice water at your disposal and towels.  Plenty of cardio machines as well overlooking the gardens.  I think the best part of that nasty additional fee is that you also get access to the spa facility. (See other review) Inspired me to get up earlier each day to incorporate both facilities into my busy days.

Like other reviews stated, it is not the cardio room but it is on the Spa side. Although it was advertised as opening at 6am, there were a few mornings they opened early just for me since I was standing in the doorway looking helpless lol ( thank you) It really is a nice spot with enough weights as long as it is not crowded. They have a few machines as well for you to use if needed. I was in there to use all the weights they had after running on the strip. I think I surprised a few people by telling them that as they looked at me like I a deer in headlights. At any rate, I will definitely be using this spot again when I come back to Vegas for work.
