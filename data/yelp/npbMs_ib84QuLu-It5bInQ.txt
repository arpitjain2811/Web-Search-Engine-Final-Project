Normally we choose not to go to Edinburgh for gigs but there simply wasn't the choice this time. Slash feat Myles Kennedy at the Corn Exchange 7th October, was one of our rare visits to the capital for a gig. We were really looking forward to the gig itself, if a little dubious about the venue. Having heard previously that it's far from a great venue, I can only say now that we agree. Parking is a flippin nightmare, unless you're one of those who likes to be at a venue super-early. The acoustics of the place are, well, mince and the general atmosphere is lacking some serious oomph. Definitely would not rush back to the corn exchange for another gig.
