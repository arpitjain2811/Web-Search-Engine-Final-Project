Coolest boutique in Las Vegas to visit!! Such good deals on fun hats, boas in every color, feather lashes, tutus, wings and so much more!! Not to mention the most amazing bodypainting that goes on from the best in Las Vegas!! They can do anything, even bellies for expecting mommies!! The owner, Robin, can customize your design! An incredible hair and makeup staff will have you looking fabulous to complete the look! I accompanied my friend for her belly session and it was such a wonderful experience and she was truly happy with the outcome;) now she's got  beautiful professional photos taken there at the studio to last a lifetime! I highly recommend this place!!

I am IN LOVE  with Hair flowers and good affordable hair flowers are very hard to find. If you obsession is anything like mine than this is the place for you. AND DID I MENTION THE TUTUS. Every time I come home from Vegas I don't leave without stopping by and grabbing 11 new flowers for my hair currently at 40 :-). They have everything you need at a great price. They might have sparked a new desire for lipstick designs.
