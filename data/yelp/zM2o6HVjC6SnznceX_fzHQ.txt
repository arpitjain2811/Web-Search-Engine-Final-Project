I tried hard to look for a flaw in this place. Desperately peering in every corner to find a half eaten bacon roll wedged under something (usually someones foot), but I couldn't find anything. This place was spotless, but that's where it's biggest downfall is. It's too perfect and lacks a little character. But who cares when they serve really good cheap food. Get the Bacon Roll, pre-trampled.

i come here quite a lot as my friend lives in a flat only 2 minutes around the corner from here. Much like the decor, simplicity is they key at Koffee Pot. It is a good, cheaper alternative to the generic coffee shops around town. Koffee Pot makes a good option for lunch if you are are keen on having a full tummy on a budget. Koffee Pot is about as average as it gets, it doesn't step out of line, the food is good, the layout is good, the price is good. But on the other hand it doesn't do anything that makes it more than ok.
