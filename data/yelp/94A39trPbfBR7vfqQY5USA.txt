Awful experience. They installed a washer incorrectly and it ended up leaking and causing thousands of dollars of damage to my home. They admitted fault but handled the situation poorly and didn't pay for the damages.

Just bought all new appliances and the customer service/sales lady was very helpful and did everything she could to ensure we got the best prices and we had our appliances delivered and install the next day.  Key - She was not pushy with the service agreements all the other stores try to shove down your throat.  She offered we declined that was the end.   Purchased: GE, Range, Dishwasher, and Microwave.
