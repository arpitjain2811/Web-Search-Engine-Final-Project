Looks like another small airport to me! Good service and easy coming and going from this facility.

Nice little airport.  Can't wait to fly in and out of here on my G5 one day.  Hopefully!

Great place to fly into. Friendly people and staff. Fueling service is excellent, and the terminal is pretty good.
