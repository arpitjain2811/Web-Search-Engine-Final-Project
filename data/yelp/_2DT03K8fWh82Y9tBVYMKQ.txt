Saw the negative review, but I was close and thought I would give it a try. The staff was nice, and they were running a promotion on my favorite sandwich. I was there at 1:30, and didn't notice any slow service. A nice place.

This seems to be a busy location, at least during lunch time. Service was prompt and employees were cordial.

I was at their neighbor location (19th ave and northern) and asked for a single party platter. I sat and waited for 45 minutes and they have not yet started it. I decided to call this location, 19th ave and Glendale, and asked when they could have one made. Before I arrived to the location the platter was finished and packed up with cookies within 10 minutes.  Customer service was the best that I've experienced. 100% would return to eat here again. Extremely satisfied with their prompt service.

We stopped going to Subway a year or two ago after repeated horrible experiences. But I'm surprised to say that this was BY FAR the best Subway experience my boyfriend and I have ever had. Jessie (I really hope thats her name), was OUTSTANDING. She was so nice, offered us everything and then some, smiled the whole time, and even thanked us for coming in. It was everything you want a Subway experience to be. GREAT HIRE, SUBWAY!!

Subway is decent for a quick and easy nosh.  I always get a turkey with spinach on wheat (now without yoga mat!) and it's a good light dinner.  The food is fresher than most fast food which is good and the low price is even better.
