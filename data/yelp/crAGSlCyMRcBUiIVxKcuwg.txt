The appetizer platter was the starter, it came out practically the same time as the pizza but I ordered the individual pizza so it didn't bother me much.   The appetizer platter is full of bread items, the breadsticks were killer. The cheesesticks were coated in a pretzel crust which I didn't like that much. Potato skins were loaded with bacon and it was quite filling.  The pizza is what to come here for though folks, the meat pizza is killer, the crust and sauce is the perfect combo for the pizza. The sauce even had ground beef in it which sealed the deal... :) There is a full bar, and a small pool table as well as arcade games for the kids although I think they were grownup games (golf?) Didn't notice happy hour but the staff was happy and smiley, and their cocktails were pretty tasty.
