Cool tiki / island bar theme. Has the feel of being inside a cave. Drinks are cheap and well poured. Lots of t.v.'s and a stage for karaoke and open mic night. Occasionally they have live bands.

I went here with my out of town guests to redeem a match play deal advertised on the bar's Web site. It's a typical neighborhood poker bar with a tropical theme (love the small waterfall) and tiki decor. Any place that offers a match play is a winner in my book, though we didn't try the food. The bartender offered to serve the Blue Moon with orange juice, which is also a winner.  This is a Steelers bar, and as such, promos and prizes are offered during all games.

Great locals bar, have a decent bar food menu, most of the items are around $5, 1 pool table, cheap drinks beers come in 3 different size glasses, single beer, pitcher and they have a beer tower that is almost 100oz. $10 domestic, $13.50 import. They had music and karaoke but construction has halted that. Pretty decent internet based jukebox and plenty of TV's to watch the game or what ever else may be playing. Over all its a pretty kick back place to relax.

Came out to Island grill for the first time Saturday night...well ok, Sunday morning, at about 2am.   I really like this place.  Very open, spacious, clean, with a "tiki hut" kind of feel... Tero, the bartender, was incredible, pouring REALLY strong drinks! Drinks are super cheap and good here.  I can't believe I waited so long to come out.   I'll go back again soon.
