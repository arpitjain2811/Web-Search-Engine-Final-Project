Dante's has always been a reliable, friendly local Italian restaurant. Not only is the decor and atmosphere great, but the menu is of a higher standard and more varied than most.  It is child friendly but still a pleasant setting for a romantic meal for two, great to pop in for a pizza or pasta lunch, but offering excellect choice for a special occasion.  I can recommend the prawn and scallop ravioli. It has been a while since I last visited and i was pleasantly surprised to see that the prices for food and wine have not gone up and remain extremely reasonable. I can see that we'll be visiting regularly again..
