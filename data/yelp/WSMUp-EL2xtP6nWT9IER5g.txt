Dr. Joseph Candela at LV Urology is excellent.  He puts you at ease, seems very competent and honest and pays attention to your problems.

I like this guy, he is funny, knows his stuff cares about his patient and has little fingers (he is a urologist, men know what I mean)

This place is awesome!  If you don't mind waiting for hours at end. I am writing this review while I wait. Again! The people working here are great, professional and friendly. I had a vasectomy done and I have to say that I am very pleased with the results. Would I do it all over again? Yes, but not at this place. I understand they are busy, but come on! Don't book so many appointments. Ever heard of, "don't bite more than you can chew"?
