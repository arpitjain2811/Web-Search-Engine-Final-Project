Service was very friendly, but we waited 19 minutes for one turkey sub and one steak and cheese sub during lunch. I dont know if we could return for lunch due to unreliable wait times...

Good bread and ingredients. Be sure to ask what is added to your sub. Barbecue sauce shouldn't be on everything.

How can one give a Firehouse sub less than 4 stars? I've never had any problem at this location or any other location. the only reason I can see Firehouse having issues is if they are just opening. Trying to train a bunch of 16yr olds how to make subs on a line is difficult and things are going to go wrong. This location is new so maybe that was part of their gowing pains! Can't go wrong with many of these subs, FTW!

Great subs and friendly service . Lots of hot and spice sauces to add as well. Go for the "real" subs , not the low calorie ones, the difference is big in flavor and taste !

Such nice employees at this place! Patient and helpful. I needed just a side of chicken breast to feed my dogs and they were happy to accommodate. The subs are so yummy and we love the Under 500 Calorie choices! Great place ;-)
