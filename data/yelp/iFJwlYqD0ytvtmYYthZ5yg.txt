Restaurant is fully armed and operational. The play place is still under construction as of March 7 2011. The remodel looks very nice.

I rarely stop by this Mickey D's, but did because the Kid and his friend wanted a snack on the way back home....so we stopped here so they could satisfy their Big Mac Attack. Food was fast, order was accurate, kids were happy = pops happy. 3 Stars. Return Factor - 35%
