I have used Sun City Auto for several years now. They are honest, caring and friendly. I have never been disappointed in their service. Even the waiting area shows a lot of thought. Comfortable furniture, big screen TV, current reading material, Keurig coffee maker along with snacks. Don't mind waiting a bit! However, a ride home is in the offing if you so choose. I cannot say enough about this company. Even my son, who has his own mechanic business in Southern California, says "Stick with them Mom".

Finally, an honest place to take your car.  Don't bother looking anywhere else.  The owner takes the time to review everything with you and explains everything in detail.  The place is great. Thank you.
