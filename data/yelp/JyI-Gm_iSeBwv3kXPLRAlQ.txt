This QT is located right next to the Candystore "Gentlemen's" club.  This corner was screaming for some other business to move in for years.  This QT is awesome!  Brightly lit, numerous and large filling stations, and super clean.  The gas here is a good 10 cents cheaper than the one a few miles north and south.  Which is huge for me since my car costs about $60-$70 to fill up.  I am the anti-Prius.  I also ran in and found they had Xyience Cran Razz.  My new addiction thanks to Richard Z.  I bought 3 in about 3 seconds.  Checkout time there is super fast and the employees are always really nice no matter time of day.

I love this store. I work at another quiktrip and have yet to see a place as clean or as friendly staffed as this one. Good folks there.

I love always being greeted with a "hi" whenever I walk in. The young men and women who work here are incredibly polite. The drink possibilities are vast, although I usually get the green tea. Sometimes I treat myself to a delicious cappuccino. And I must say, it has some of the best doughnuts in town, and they are only 59 cents after 3 pm!

Pretty standard gas station for this chain.  Clean, easy to find a pump considering how large this location is and standard priced for area.  Been to this one several times and never had an issue and am always able to easy get gas and get out in a timely manner! Overall: A  Quick and easy.
