I like this place! Every time Ive been in any of these stores the products has been of high quality and the prices are ok for this type of store. I have never been disapointed with their products after purchase.

I walked in with very high hopes and walked out very disappointed. It really reminded me of one of those weird grocery stores in London where all the food is pre-packaged and icky. All I really wanted was a head of lettuce and some nice produce. I walked out with nothing. EVERYTHING is packaged. I had know idea!! This place is anything but Fresh. Easy yes....fresh no. I will stick to Trader Joe's.
