What a friendly staff!  The office just recently opened, and I now know where I'll be taking my kids for their 6 month check-ups!!  They treated me so kindly, and were fast/efficient.  Plus my kids loved the movies/video games/play room while I was filling out the paperwork.  I seriously love this place!!
