The only street wear boutique in Tempe!! Besides Urban Outfitter which is across the street! A shop like this can be found in your West LA shopping district! They have 10Deep, Crooks, Kid Robot, The Hundreds and many more! For now I'll give a 4 store since its new in the valley until they get more brands I like from the West LA area and the rating will go up! They are on the right track though! One of the owner is real nice! Got a real nice greeting when we got in! Place is designed just like a street wear boutique should look like! Small and what ever you need he will get it for you from the back! Heard one of the owner is Javon Walker who is also a good friend of Anquan Boldin! Probably why his shop is in AZ! Its close to my house so I'll be there often to get what I need!

If you like street wear, go here. Crooks, The Hundreds, Stussy, Hellz, Creative Rec just to name a few. My dad loves this shop.  I like it because Derek let's me chill on the leather couches and watch cartoons on their flat screens.

Does not exists. May of use to but not anymore. Phone number doesn't lead to anything and the address on mill is incorrect.
