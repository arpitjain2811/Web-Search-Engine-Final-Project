Ever since hosting iQ nights I've gotten to love the King Club. The owner and staff are incredibly nice and fun. Small venue provides for a great live music experience.

So, everyone that has ever taken a flight has seen that one other really attractive person waiting in line and hoped that they would end up sitting next to them by some random twist of fate. I was the lucky man once. Her name was Ashley. She was a traveling salesperson working in the education field. She was a cute petite little blond with eyes that could light up the night. On our second date, I took her to the king club. I never saw her again. I blame the bar. Clearly this situation is not my fault.
