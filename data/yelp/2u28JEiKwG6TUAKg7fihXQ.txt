Sucky drum roasted coffee (although they claim it is air-roasted).   This place made a huge turn for the worse then they bought shitty ancora, and are apparently trying to emulate them now.

We love their coffee!  My wife picks it up at Willy St. Co-Op.

Madison has quite a few good coffee roasters.  This one is our favorite.  Amazing coffee and very socially aware.  Can buy it at Willy St Coop, and you can also get the Bucky Blend at the Babcock Dairy on campus.
