I'm a bit of a sucker when it comes to bargains. Hey, I'm only human. Sally's provides just that. If I have a big event coming up, I come here for the DIY nails, body lotions, face-masks and hair-masks. They sell them in bulk too, so it lasts a long, long time. I still have a mud mask I bought 4 years ago. They have a great selection of fake nails and tans, so you can take your pic. I prefer to come here over Boots or any of the big boys, because I trust the quality in Sally's so I know it will be a good product.  I thoroughly recommend said same mud mask and their moisturizing face masks, they really work and last forever!!
