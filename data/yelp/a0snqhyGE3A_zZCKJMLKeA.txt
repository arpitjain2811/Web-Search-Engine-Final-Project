This dollar store is pretty good. It's kind of hidden, but it's a gem. They have a nice selection of products and even grocery items. FYI: They don't sell the Sunday paper.

Stopped in to take a look around, it has a lot to offer, for $1.  While walking around overheard an employee talking to someone from corporate and she was saying that this store is one of the biggest and busiest in the Las Vegas area.   Liked the selections and picked up a few bargains.  This is like any other dollar store, you just have look to find the bargains.

I LOVE Dollar Tree.  I home-school my daughter and supplies can be expensive.  Dollar Tree has reward stickers, paper posters!!  They also have a great party department so throwing a birthday party is less expensive.  My husband has started calling it the $20 store cause I never get out of there without spending $20.
