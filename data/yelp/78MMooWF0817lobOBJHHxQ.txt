I visit this QT every single day.  Everyone is nice and chipper willing to help.  They even remind me when I forget to tell them I brought my old cup in.  Seriously... QT is always clean, well lit and I always feel safe.  Three cheers Quick Trip!

Stopped here for gas on the way to work. Easy to get in and back out again and the service is great. Clean store as well and easy to find what you need and get on your way.
