I like Tropical Smoothie Cafe and if you work anywhere near family court, you MUST be as excited as I am that this place opened!!  I went on April 25, and I think it had just opened the day before or something like that.  It was crowded (see the aforementioned excitement at this place opening near family court) but well staffed.  I think they were still working out some bugs as everyone ordered PRETTY MUCH the same thing yet the prices were ALL OVER THE BOARD, but I do think they will get this worked out.  The food was good, the smoothies were great, and I am hopeful the service will follow!!
