This is the one I call the "Other" Jordan's. Not because it is any worse, only because it isn't the one I grew up eating at. This Jordan's is downtown, along a little strip of restaurants including the Caddy Corner, Durant's, and Thaiger. And the food here is slightly different from the other Jordan's, but just as good.  The service here is quicker but more in tune with a lunch crowd, since most of their customers pop in from neighboring office buildings. It is very dark inside but it serves as a nice respite in the summertime when the sun glares at such absurd temperatures.  They have some lunch specials that aren't available at the 7th street location, and even some deviations from traditional mexican fare like ham and cheese sandwiches or burgers. My recommendation is to dance with the fella that brought you, so don't stray too far from the tacos and enchiladas.

Jordans has been closed for 3-4 years now. Much to my dissapointment because I always enjoyed going here for lunch and getting their tostadas. RIP Jordans.
