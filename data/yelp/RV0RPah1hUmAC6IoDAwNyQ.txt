When it's over 100 degrees outside, the monorail can't be beat.  It runs from MGM to the end of the strip. I found it to be very user friendly and they have posted which stops are for each hotel.  A little on the steep side, but cheaper than a taxi.  Be aware: the landing area is NOT air conditioned.
