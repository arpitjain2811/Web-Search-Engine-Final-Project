I went here with a Groupon and have been seeing Patricia for six months now.  She is a great lady and is as nice as they get.  I have had  several  microdermabrasion  and a peel.

I'm so glad that my first facial was from Patricia.  She is professional, kind, and very accommodating to her clients.  I left my first appointment feeling (and I personally feel looking) five years younger.  I am officially hooked.

Saw Patricia for first time this week. So impressed. Just the best combo of skill and personality. Beautiful, classy and well appointed suite. I had a microderm and enzyme mask. Skin still feels great. I've been looking for a new aesthetician since the woman i had been seeing up and moved out of state. Patricia was the third person I've seen and as they say, third time is the charm.
