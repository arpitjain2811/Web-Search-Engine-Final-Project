I had a delious chicken filly deluxe sub. Everything is freshly made. The chicken is grilled and very tender and not dried out.

We had a coupon for this place and decided to give it a try during our shopping trip.  I've never had a Charley's Sub before, so I was excited.  We decided to order: Regular Italian, $5.29 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/charleys-grilled-subs-anthem?select=fZxmXauV9ciNPj8SPisQIQ#fZxmXauV9ciNPj8SPisQIQ Large Italian, $7.39 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/charleys-grilled-subs-anthem?select=I0pt09WSTu4HUys2n5feVw#I0pt09WSTu4HUys2n5feVw Fries & Soda, $2.79 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/charleys-grilled-subs-anthem?select=iQxsYTvbpHwvf1wCG8MVbg#iQxsYTvbpHwvf1wCG8MVbg The Italian Sandwich was very tasty and full of flavor.  The Fries were excellent too...reminds me of the Fries at 5 Guys.  I'll have to look around the Scottsdale area to see if there's a location closer to home.  The meal exceeded my expectations. BTW - There's FREE WiFi available in the food court area where Charley's is located. Return Factor - 80%

Spicy Hawaiian Chicken is good.  coming back from Grand Canyon, just happen to stop by here for food.  and i happened to order this, not knowing the taste, sub, but boy it hit the spot.  I was completely satisfied and it was so good~  just the way i like it with a little spiciness and a little sweetness.  If i ever pass by this place again, i'll probably stop by again.  *My rating is based on Spicy Hawaiian Chicken only.

Food...pretty good sub. Ok price for what you're getting. Ambiance...this is in the food court at the Outlets = loud and noisy. Fairly clean, restrooms are immaculate Staff....the outlet staff is friendly, Charley's sub staff just ok. Verdict....if you're tired of subway (just a few stalls down) and don't mind spending a few extra dollars, this is a passable choice.
