Tommy Bahamas Outlet is new to me, but we were very impressed with the offerings found in this high quality clothier. I've been to a few Tommy Bahamas over the years, mostly on the west coast.  Their clothes are of a very high quality and trendy.  Particularly if you you are walking off a beach or are in the island setting. That is not a snarky comment, but a statement on their style and appearance.  I like the look very much and was surprised that they had an outlet store. Virtually everything in the store is marked at 50% off, see photo. I also liked the steel drummer playing as you come to get you in the mood.  Very nice!

Beautiful colors and clothing and good value, but poor selection of XL and waist over 38.  If you're a skinny gent or lady, this is the store for you.  I guess "the good life" according to Bahama has no room for eating well ;)
