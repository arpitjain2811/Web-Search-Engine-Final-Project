This place is off the strip so the prices are better here.  Has everything you need to take to the hotel.  Local types here and friendly service.  Not a lot of transients hanging around like other places in the area.

Drug dealers aren't perfect. Thankfully, there's Walgreens. #DrinkTussin

I normally don't come to Walgreens to buy anything as they are more pricey then Walmart, but I do like that this is very convenient and close to my house. The times I've gone the store is clean, organized and quiet. Never really had a problem finding the item that I went in to buy.
