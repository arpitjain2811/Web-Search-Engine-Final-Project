They do a 15 minute meet and greet interview with any of their pediatritians. Great way to find the right baby doctor for your little one.

The practitioners here truly are healthcare professionals in every sense of the word. For adults I recommend NP Wendy Gallagher. She takes the time to truly get to know you and make you feel empowered and informed in your health care, and on top of it she is friendly and knowledgable. For pediatrics all three of them are great but Dr Lipp is my favorite! So glad this facility opened- and it being so close to home is just the icing on the cake!
