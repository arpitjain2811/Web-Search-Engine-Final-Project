Tammy was wonderful with my fill and shellac polish.  She had a great attention to detail and ensured they looked perfect.  Anne did my pedicure. I sprung for the reflexology pedicure and was in heaven. Such a long massage and great detail to ensure my toes look just as good as my fingers. They have won me over!!! Definitely come here for quality and friendly service! !

I will say they wete definitely thorough....i was there for quite awhile getting a mani/pedi. Glad i didn't have anywhere to be. I was nicked twice and bled. My polish is already chipped and smeared from normal wear...less than 24 hours. I have a couple big red marks on one leg from too "vigourous" a scrub massage. My heels are tender from the same over-enthusiasm with the scraper thing. It was $50 for the mani-pedi....most places offer a deal for the combo and i was very surprised to hear the price.  Bad/Bloody/Expensive....AVOID.

This place is really good. They pay a lot of attention to the toes, more so than many places. I've been to the very popular places nearby, and I can't understand the appeal. I think the staff here do a better job. Great work, I'll continue to come back!
