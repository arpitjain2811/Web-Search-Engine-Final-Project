Zizzi is delicious and has a spectacular view. The wait has never been long and the servers pleasant. All the menu items have good flavor and fresh ingredients. No one waiter is assigned to wait on you so you have a variety of waiters which was different for us as Americans, but they manage to stay on top of things. In the short time we lived there, we frequented Zizzi probably a dozen times.
