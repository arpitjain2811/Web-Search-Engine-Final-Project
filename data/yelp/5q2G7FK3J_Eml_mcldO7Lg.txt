Attached to a Shell station and a convenience store of all things. And it's a drive through. What more do you need? And the wi-fi worked great while we filled up the car! East of Phoenix/Mesa on Route 60, this is truly the last stop / first stop from the nothing that lives between Phoenix and the Superstition Mountains.

Slowest McDonald's I have ever been too. Nice staff but slow. Literally sat in line in drive through 10-15 mins at the window on three separate occasions. If you go inside it's worse.

Packaged food and gas? Great! Hot food and restrooms? Not very good.

Only because you can't give it a half star.  Terrible employees,  dirtiest McDonald's I have ever seen.   Lousy service.
