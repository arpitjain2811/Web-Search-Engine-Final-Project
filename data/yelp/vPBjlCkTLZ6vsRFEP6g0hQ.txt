I was able to return an item no questions asked and use the store credit towards a new item. Hassle free!

Yeah, it's a big box store, but they've got so much cool stuff.  When my wife said she wanted to go there, I was just happy that a BevMo was across the street.  But we never got to BevMo and I was happy.  It sounds lame to marvel at "helpful" doodads for around the house, but there are so many cool things there that you're sure to get some good stuff.
