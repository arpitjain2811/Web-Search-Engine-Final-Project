The sushi rolls were hard to pick up because it would just fall apart and it didn't really have an authentic Japanese flavor. I also thought it was gross that the sushi was really warm and how they drowned the rolls with creamy sauce. The display of the sushi was a bit sloppy,but maybe it was because the place was about to close. Overall I wouldn't come back here again because it smells like musty ,day-old fish and the sushi isn't impressive

I had booked a table on opentable.com for our family with 2 kids. Upon arrival we very almost immediately showed to our table. Not only was it in a quiet corner spot as requested but it came prepared with 2 kids menus in addition to regular ones. (Btw - the kids menus are awesome). Needless to say, the kids very happy.  Now the food: once you make those difficult choices on what to order (the menu is HUGE), you'll get excellent food one after the other. The cold noodles (always forget the name) were delicious. The garlic steak terrific. Need to add that the service is top notch. And after all that food - which is plenty - you will like that the check is very reasonable.  To sum it up: one of the best dining experiences we had as a family in a long time. We'll be back and I would recommend this place to anyone in the area.
