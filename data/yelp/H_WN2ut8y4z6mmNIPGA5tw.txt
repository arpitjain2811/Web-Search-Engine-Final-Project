I recently had an emergency trip I needed to take.  As I was going home to pack I noticed I was getting a flat tire.  I stopped at our local Big O, told them my situation and they had me on my way in under 30 minutes, at zero cost.  It was a FANTASTIC service.

This is NOT the place for an oil change.  Went there today, told it would be 45 minutes. Went back over an hour later, car still hasn't been taken into the garage area. Over two hours later it was finally completed. I did not receive an apology from anyone for the fact that I waited over double the time I was told by the boy at the front desk.  Used a $14.99 coupon for the service, came out to more than $20 due to some crap "fee."  Go somewhere else for an oil change... I know I won't be returning.
