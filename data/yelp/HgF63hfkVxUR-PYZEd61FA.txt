Great new shop. Owner is very friendly and nice to chat with, giving the small business appeal. There is a good selection of trade paperbacks and new issues. Statues are present as well, I don't collect them but they have some very nice pieces. They appear to have some great back issues in the case, but not all are priced and are not easy to view. Back issue bins are also not organized the best and limited.

Shop says open 7 days a week 11am to 7pm, call and you get a msg saying the same.  Showed up on a Sunday after driving a half hour to check it out and they are closed. It's 2pm and now I'm disappointed and upset.  2 things I was not expecting.  The least you could have done is changed your msg to say you were closed.

Discovered this store by chance after running an errand and was very impressed with the variety and selection of comics, books, and collectibles. I've been to most comic stores in Vegas and this little gem is solid. The store owner was friendly and chatted it up easily. Also, great music playing in the background. Definitely going to be visiting again and recommend a visit.
