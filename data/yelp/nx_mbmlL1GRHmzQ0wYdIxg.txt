CVS is known as a great Pharmaceutical chain that also offers everyday grocery items.  This store located off the 215 and Valley Verede is a great addition to this wonderful chain. The savings and weekly specials are very hard to beat at CVS.  I have always enjoyed the service and 24 hour drive through Pharmacy at almost every location.  Awesome store!!!
