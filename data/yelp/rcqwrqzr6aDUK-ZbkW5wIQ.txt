Literally amazed.  13 days to send out a technician to hook up our new Internet connection.  Believe it.  Couldn't get Cox in our condo building unfortunately, so we're stuck with Century Link - some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced from a service provider.  The only saving grace - the folks on the phone were very nice... Albeit useless and unable to send out anybody to help us out earlier.  Truly amazing.

LOVE this company. We have better quality, less expensive and so much more than we ever did with Cox.  I'm glad Cox is no longer the monopoly.
