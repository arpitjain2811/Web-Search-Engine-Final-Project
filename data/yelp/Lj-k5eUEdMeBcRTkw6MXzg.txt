One of my favorite "fitness centers" when traveling away from home.  This workout facility is a good size with various cardio and hammer strength machines.  There is also a free weights area with two adjustable work benches.  The dumbells range from 25lbs to 75lbs so it's more than sufficient for the average gym goer.  The four big screen TVs also make it very enticing for an extended session of cardio exercising!

The Orleans Spa was so accommodating! Called for aesthetician, pimple on day before wedding, and everyone there was so nice and helpful! Jonna helped me out at NO CHARGE and was beyond nice. The front desk gal was also so helpful and nice. Would recommend this spa to everyone and anyone! So thankful they were available to help!
