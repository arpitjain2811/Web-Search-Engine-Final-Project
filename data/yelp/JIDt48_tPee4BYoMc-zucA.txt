For a furniture store this place gets a score of zero stars as they don't have any. As a home decor store I give it a two, because at least they carry those items, atrocious as they may be to the senses.  We walked in and right out, as the smell of something (candles? Potpourri? Formaldehyde?) was so overwhelming I had to get out of there ASAP.  Maybe you'll have better luck or not as sensitive of nostrils. Regardless, definitely not a furniture shop.
