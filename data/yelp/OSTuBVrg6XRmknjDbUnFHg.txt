Wow love Sandy!!! She is the amazing owner of this salon and has always made my experiences over the years absolutely wonderful! She knows customer service and how to treat her customers! I have been going to this salon for the whole time I lived in Vegas and every time I come back into town for business or pleasure I make sure to come and get my nails done by Sandy. She pays attention to detail and makes sure to ask exactly what you want and checks throughout that you are happy! Go to this nail salon and you will be very happy! The gel pink and white nails that I get last very long like over a month and stay bright and shiny which shows the great products they use!

I went in with the worst feet ever and they made them really nice.  They also gave me advice on how to get the calluses gone for good.  Sandy gave me great advice.
