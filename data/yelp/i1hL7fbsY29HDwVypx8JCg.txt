(+) - coconut water - .99 cent donuts (-) - ghetto Open 24 hrs (a given) so it's great for any late night junk food or hydration needs. If youre staying at El Cortez this location is prime for you.  They have coconut water! which, strangely we couldn't find at any other 7-11's we stopped at or at walgreens. Also the .99 cent donuts are yummy.  Downside, parking lot is tiny and if you're a girl you'll probably get hollered at by one or two older creepy ugly guys.

Very hood area.  Had what I needed tho.
