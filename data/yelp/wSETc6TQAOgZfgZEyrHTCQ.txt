This place has good pickings. A little more expensive than St Vincent Depaul's, but the stuff tends to be nicer. They've got the main staples of a thrift store: a fair amount of glasswares and kitchen garb along with a modest furniture selection. Clothes can be found in the back.

The staff is super friendly but the prices are RIDICULOUS! I was thinking; "this crap didn't cost this much when it was new!!"
