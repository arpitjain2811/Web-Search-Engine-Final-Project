Best service at a Subway I've ever received!  And the ladies were blasting the best 80's dance music! And to some the Tuna sandwich sounds gross, but it's actually very good.  Try it toasted!

Best service at a local Subway. The other stores are not nearly as knowledgeable about the product, pricing, or options as this one.

I have been coming to this subway during my lunch hour for over a year. The service use to be great but there was a staff change that occurred over 6 mths ago. They have never been very friendly, but today especially everyone had a bad attitude! Staff is very rude. Some of the workers were even  slamming doors and being rude to one another as well as to the customers. I don't recommend eating here!!

Ghetto. Have to ask for EVERYTHING, I'm assuming because of the local population stealing everything that is not nailed down if it's free.

This is not the closest Subway to where I live but I've started going here because they consistently are more generous with the toppings than the other two I occasionally go to.

One of the worst managers of a Subway ever!  The workers are jammed, b/c short staffed, the supplies are barely adequate, and the manager is sarcastic and flippant.  There is a much better subway on west Bethany Home near the freeway.

The crew at this store is not one bit customer friendly. They seemed more interested in throwing out the trash and banging pans together than assembling my foot long.  I was adrenaline happy and just off a good solid hour of the best cardio in weeks. My expectations are not even close to a dog a pony show but could you have at least acknowledged my obvi existence.  Aint coming back period
