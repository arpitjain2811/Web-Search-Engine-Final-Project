As I'm strolling through the Carefree Holiday Festival I spot this lovely woman with a big smile on her face. Why is she smiling? Because she's surrounded by freshly made baked goods - that's why!  It also turns out that she's a very nice woman that clearly loves what she does. And what she does is make excellent baked goods. I got the peach cobbler cookies and a small caramel apple pie. Wow! I've never had peach cobbler cookies before so I can't compare them to anything but they were delicious.  The apple pie was one of the best I've ever had. It was cooked to perfection and had just the right amount of spice. She's working hard to get her business going. While I'm sure you'll see her at the major craft festivals you can also go to her shop or order online.  You'll be glad you did.

Loved the unique flavors of the cookies.  Perfect texture and tasted great! Got some as a gift and they were packaged beautifully.  Will try them again.
