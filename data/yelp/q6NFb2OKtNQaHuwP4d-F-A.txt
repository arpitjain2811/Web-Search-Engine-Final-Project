Shannon was great.  I finally found someone who knows what she is talking about and takes the time to explain procedures.  She did not try to up sell.  I can't wait for my next appointment that is next week, getting another wax and a peel.

My skin was broken out and Shannon gave me a peel and my skin never felt better! Shannon is very informative and she will not upsell you which is a very big plus. She really knows her products and is very knowledgeable with different types of skin. She takes pride in what she does, it shows and I value that. Shannon is like a mystic gem. Once you grab hold of one, don't ever let it go because she is well worth it! Beauty and knowledge, it doesn't get any better than that!!! Thanks Shannon for making me beautiful!!!

I buy the mineral makeup from Shannon and it is the absolute best. It is all natural, doesn't leave my skin oily and shiny, no breakouts. Shannon takes the time to blend it to your natural skin tone and matches me better than the pre-packaged stuff from the stores. Shannon also gives me samples of products to help my breakouts; she is all about great, clear skin!! =)
