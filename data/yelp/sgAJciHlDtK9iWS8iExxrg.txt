I was visiting from California when I noticed an oil leak. I took my car to this location and the guys there were awesome. Very honest and helpful. Checked my car, fixed my leak, and I was on my way.

OK, I just went there today to have  my pickup serviced, and it occurred to me that these guys always treat me pretty well.  They never seem to be super busy and I'm not sure why, but I was in and out in about 15 minutes.

Quick service. Everything else is very poor. Customer service poor. Adding on unnecessary charges not approved by me. Explanation of what I actual need and what they say I should get was fuzzy and couldn't get a straight answer really. No... I'll try and find another place I won't feel taken advantage of
