It's pretty gross, but just barely edible and if you drown it in ranch it's not bad.  ---Yelpers give me a break I was buzzed and it was only $5 bucks.

These guys are great. They come out to my car so I don't have to leave my babies to run in. $5 dollar pizza in 10 seconds. Feeds our whole family. Can't beat it.

Yes, I bribe my students with pizza parties. It effectively motivates them to work hard. This pizza is cheap and the students always gobble it up. I personally don't eat it, but I'm a pizza snob. Thanks for making a cheap pizza that kids love!
