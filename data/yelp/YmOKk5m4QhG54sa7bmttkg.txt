Peg & Doc's is a fun, chill, divey, towny bar in Dane. If you visit on a Friday, try the fish fry for only $11, get a mix of baked and fried fish.  You won't be disappointed.  There's plenty of seating outside the bar area if you're in the mood for food and want to avoid the bar crowd. If you're in the mood to drink, play foosball, shoot a game of pool and listen to a digital jukebox, you're in luck cause they have all that too.

Excellent burgers!! A sandpit volleyball court and a couple of horseshoe pits look like they could be fun, too.
