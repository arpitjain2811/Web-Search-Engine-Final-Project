Food is good, I mean its Taco Bell ! But the girls working here RUDE, I can't even enjoy my dinner in peace and quiet with my fianc√© . They were being so loud and obnoxious, singing at the top of their lungs, screaming across the room to one another. Did you forget you had customers eating here???
