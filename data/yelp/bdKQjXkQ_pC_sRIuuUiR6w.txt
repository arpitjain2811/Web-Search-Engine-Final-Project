So yesterday my Wife had an appointment and we had a 2HR wait before she got to see the DR just to get refills on her scripts. Why they over book I have no idea . And  why the waiting room is so small with that many people.? Everyone in the room was upset over the wait..... It killed our day by having to wait an EXTRA 2 HRS. If you show up late for you appointment they will turn you away. If you go here take a book with you so you have something to do.
