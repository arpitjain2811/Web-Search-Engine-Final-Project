What a beautiful facility. ( I was there for a good reason CCW).  Didn't see the whole place but sure liked what I saw. Customer service was FAST and I like that it is somewhat centralized and was easy freeway access.

Horrible customer service and really long wait times for a simple report. I've waited over a half hour to file a stolen car report and the woman who assisted me had an attitude problem. They have their system set up like a dmv office where you wait for your number to be called to get any assistance.

ok so coming to this type of places i always expect to be treated bad and rude but i was wrong! the location was easy to find and right when i was walked in there was a line and then to the left you see the people waiting kinda like the DMV. when it was my turn to step up the lady at the window greeted and i told her what i was there for and she explained what i had to do then she gave me a ticket. i went into the other room and started to fill out some paperwork and next thing i knew my number was already called up! keep in mind it was pretty busy too. I was in and out of this place quicker than i though. all the staff was so friendly and didn't make you feel bad or treated you any different here!

If you think the DMV lines are bad you are in for a surprise. Leave a whole day open if a record check is needed.
