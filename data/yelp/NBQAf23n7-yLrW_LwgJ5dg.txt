Dr Peterson is the man! I specifically like the fact that he remembers your name every time you go see him. He makes the visit comfortable, easy, quick and most importantly, effective! I have low back problems from years of sports and a quick tune up from him and/or his staff always does the trick! Highly recommended.

My only regret is not finding this situation sooner! instant relief, nice doctor and I'm in and out in minutes. Highly recommend this place.

I've been going to The Joint in NE Mesa (Red Mountain area) for a year now and am so grateful that I found a chiropractor that both my husband and I are getting great results with our backs, necks, and stress relief. Dr. Peterson has been a great resource for us when it comes to our overall health and maintenance. This location is convenient and is in a nice area of northeast Mesa, not too far from Las Sendas and Alta Mesa neighborhoods. I have recommended many of my friends and acquaintances to Dr. Peterson because of the great back care and because it is the most affordable chiropractor care I have found. If you're looking for back relief or just a great chiropractic maintenance program, this is a great place for it.
