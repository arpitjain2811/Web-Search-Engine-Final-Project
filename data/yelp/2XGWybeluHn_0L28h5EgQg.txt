A great service to the Phoenix area and an amazingly kind and accommodating staff.  They make custom engraving an easy process for the everyday consumer.  Customer service is also the best in this city's industry from what I have experienced.  Thank you!

great place. they helped me out for an affordable price, even though it was last minute. i simply gave them a call and they gave me a time to show up at their office in the same day , where i walked out with my finished job a mere hour later. the greatest chuckle while i was there was that there was a bow-flex gym to get reps on when yourself or the technician gets board.

I am a graduate student at ASU in the architecture program and, per my usual behavior, I procrastinated until it was too late to make a reservation in my schools laser lab. Thank goodness I found Phoenix custom lasering! I called and was told to come down and that they would help me out. They were extremely accommodating! They were patient with me while I converted my files from CAD to AI so they could get the vector lines for their program.  They even stayed late to finish my job because it took me so long to get my stuff together.  The job was excellent! the plexi that they cut was sparkly clean, and the chip board wasn't burned and I really felt good about everything they did.  If there are students looking for an alternative to the Lab at ASU come here! They are really passionate about connecting with creatives and becoming part of the community They will even extend a little student discount!

The staff was very friendly. The price was reasonable and the final product was finished in a very timely manner. I will definitely be back next time I am in need of engraving! :)
