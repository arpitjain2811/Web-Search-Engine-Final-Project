the boss went out with me today for a ride along to check up on my awesome sales skills. in the path of a super busy day we needed to eat and i spied this place in the parking lot so we pulled in. this is a clean little place with plenty of seating and a very clean look. you walk up and order, pay,and then pick up at the counter. they have all kinds of sandwiches, soups, and salads + a case of baked goods and sweets. i had the balsamic blue cheese salad with chicken added. the salad had apple slices, tomatoes, walnuts, cranberry's, and mixed greens. they served the dressing on the side, it was a balsamic with raspberry, they give you two little sealed containers which is more than enough (i only used one,so if you like a lot there is plenty) they also give you a piece of fresh french bread that was also tasty. i enjoyed the salad it tasted very fresh. my boss had a classic Caesar salad with chicken and also enjoyed it (kind of hard to mess that up) all in all this is a good place to grab a quick bite. i will go back if in the neighborhood and hungry.

Always has a solid, fresh menu. Go with the California avocado sandwich.
