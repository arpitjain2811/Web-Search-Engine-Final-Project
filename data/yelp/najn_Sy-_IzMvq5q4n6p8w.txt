This Jack in the Box is pretty good.  Fast service, clean restaurant, filled-to-the top shakes and drinks at the drive-through.  I like having this place close by for 24-hour American fast food.  The children I've seen inside have appeared happy, so they must have good toys and meals.  The chocolate milk shakes are the best!

The norm, food is so so....not my first choice!  I have honestly given this restaurant chain a burger taste. Simply can't go back...maybe they have other decent food but for burgers, ah I can forget it!!

This place is disturbing. It's dirty, sticky, greasy, and reeks of filth everywhere. And that's before any review of the food.  You gotta be kidding!
