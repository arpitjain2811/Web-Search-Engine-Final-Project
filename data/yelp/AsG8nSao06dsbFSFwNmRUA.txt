Really like this cigar store. Great selection. Friendly staff. Well organized. And prices seem in line. Plus, it's located in the northwest valley where there aren't many choices.

As far as cigar collection goes it is excellent and prices are as per manufacturers. My reason for 2 stars is the customer service. The scottsdale store specially has a very snobbish, snooty vibe. The staff is overbearing and pompous. Humidor has cameras but they won't let you look at collection in peace. Costantly watch you behind your shoulder as if you will steal something. Other than Vartan staff is not knowledgeable about cigars. One guy even said all cigars are same to me they taste like cigarettes.

Best cigar shop on the Westside. I really enjoy walking into a shop where they remember your name and what cigars you smoke. I've never been suggested a bad cigar by them. If you want something they don't have, they'll just contact the Scottsdale shop and bring it over for you. No up sales either. They don't push more expensive sticks on you like a few other places do. All in all, it's pretty much the only place I buy cigars from.
