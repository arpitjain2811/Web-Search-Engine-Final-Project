Before seeing the Pointer Sisters in the Orleans, we satisfied our taste buds in Baskin Robins. Out of 31 flavors, I ordered a jacaranda in a cone. Competing against flavors including very berry strawberry, American cake, and Reeses Peanut butter; it was a difficult decision.   I recommend this Baskin Robins, if you want to grab a quick snack. With a location in the Orleans Food Court, I also recommend it for dessert.

So I kept my light dinner to one slice of pizza so I could go to the next stop at the food court and have ice cream.  Don't judge!  I had two scoops in a bowl and liked them both.  Baskin Robbins serves a decent ice cream at an almost gourmet price.  Being a chain it is predictable for quality but the service can vary among locations.
