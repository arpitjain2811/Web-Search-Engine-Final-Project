2 years in and I still love these guys...prompt, admit when and if a mistake was made (just one so far) and just plain good folks. Highly Recommend!

Super friendly and great service - took 3 vintage Hawaiian shirts to be laundered & 1 to be pressed and it was just over $10...most excellent!

I have been coming here for the last month since the good dry cleaner by my house shut down. This place is inexpensive and does a fine job.  Today I dropped off:  two dress shirts; and  one pair of pants.  Total for dry cleaning $9.50.  They will be ready Monday afternoon, this is typical of this dry cleaner's 3 day turnover rate.  When you receive your shirts they are neatly pressed with a plastic tab attached to the crossed arms.  No complaints!
