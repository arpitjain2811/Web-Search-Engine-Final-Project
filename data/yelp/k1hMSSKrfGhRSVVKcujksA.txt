Tea-rrific teas has the best selection of teas I have ever came across. They having oolong teas, green teas, black teas and the tisanes. The tea is loose teas and you can purchase them by the ounce. It is very affordable and the quality is great. Tea-arrific also offers services such as tea tastings, equipment, bags, etc.

I never use to drink tea before I ran across Louise and Tea-rrific. She knows so much about her products and picked out the PERFECT blend for me! I never knew tea could have so much flavor and so many options! If nothing else just stop by her shop to see her huge selection.

Louise is very knowledgeable about loose leaf tea.  She is also a lovely person :). If your thinking about trying loose leaf tea or wondering how to get into it, I would shoot her a call.  You can even go into her store and smell a huge amount of different teas that she has.   From what I know, she has cheaper prices, more knowledge and takes a more personal approach.

Well, Tea-rrific is no more. It is now Little Candle Tea Company. Louise is very nice and sys she works out of her home. She'll send tea via mail and has the same tea line that she had in her shop.
