Tammy is the best! She is so good at what she does, she has so much experience! My eyelashes turned out 10 times better than what I thought they would. She is a perfectionist and puts so much time and effort into her clients. I'm already addicted to my eyelash extensions!

Tammy rocks ! I have had my fair share of lash artists ... Some slow , some don't listen and some don't really care .. None of which is the case w Tammy !!  I am a woman who likes her lashes stacked full with a glamorous look ! Tammy gave me exactly what I wanted !!! Stacked .. Stacked .. Stacked !! Not only is Tammy great w lashes she has developed her own line of products w her partner Nelly ! This girl is the business !!!
