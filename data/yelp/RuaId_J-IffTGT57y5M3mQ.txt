A great addition to the Surprise area! The staff is great--polite, friendly, and they get the sandwiches done right the first time. I've used them twice for catering purposes and they were on the money! They even helped me carry my sandwiches out to the car! I gladly drive by 2 other Subways just to go to this store.

Love that there is a subway on this side of surprise. The staff is very helpful & Polite, and they are usually teenagers.  They are keeping this place clean and organized.  It is also usually a less busy location.

If the chatty, disinterested, and incapable employees moved any slower, they would be in reverse.  AVOID.   This location really suffers in the evenings and if you are tired and exhausted after a long day of work, avoid because it will only annoy you.  Just the worst ever.  Never going back.
