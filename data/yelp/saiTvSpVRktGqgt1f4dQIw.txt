First started working out here about two months back and let me tell you, the staff here is AMAZING. The equipment is great and the staff really takes the time to work with you and make sure you get the results you want. Definitely recommend LA Boxing! I think they still let you have one class for free so check it out.

I tried a free class here and I was really interested in signing up but the down payment for a membership was $279! I told the manager that I was really interested in joining his gym but the start up fee was too much. He got an attitude and told my friend and I that we were looking at him like he had two heads and he is not going to waste anymore of our time. I was hoping he would work with me. I wasn't asking for a handout but $279 is way too much considering I can go to Gold's Gym and sign up for $20. There are more affordable options out there I found Lee's ATA Martial Arts and it's $20 for unlimited classes the first month. http://www.leesatamember.com/

Thank you so much for the reviews!  Sound like the same techniques they use at 24hr fitness and la fitness.  At least the employees there are not rude like the ones in these reviews.  I'm not sending my employees to this place
