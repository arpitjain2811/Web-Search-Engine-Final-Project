I am so relieved the search is over! Cindy and Meghan totally rock. They excelled not only in response time, communication and promptness, but in the cleaning and multiple tasks that I needed done. I am pretty discerning, and continue to be impressed. Genuinely kind, extremely friendly ladies that take extreme pride in themselves, their business and their finished work. I will be using constantly and whole heartedly recommend "Just Ask Meghan."

I highly recommend Just Ask Meghan as they are highly competent, integrity driven and very trustworthy!

Cindy continues to be a lifesaver at every corner.  Every week she comes over and helps me out, even if it sometimes is a last minute request.  I am glad and very excited to have Just Ask Meghan to help me out every week.
