This used to be my favorite weekday hangout, and on Thursdays it was usually packed (with underage drinkers) for karaoke. They eventually caught on and hired a bouncer. The bar soon went empty, but this was okay with me and my friends. It got rid of the "Ohmigod, like, totally!" girls, and the "oh, yeah bro" guys, and left room for us twenty somethings to stretch out a bit. There are still some older regulars and the occasional slip of the under-ager, but it doesn't effect us. There is a jukebox, pool table, and dart board if you get bored with the video poker machines, and the bartenders are always friendly. The food is decent, and there is a cozy dining room to sit in as well. Red Hawk is a nice bar (now) for a casual drink or game of pool if you're bored on a weekday night.

This place has 2 pool tables and shuffleboard. There is also weekly karaoke. The bar staff is friendly as are the patrons. I haven't been here before and felt quite at home. That last reviewer must have been smoking crack, or a fired employee or something. Nice place to hang out.

The Red Hawk is a locals bar that is good for gamers during the day and for the partier at night.  Come as you are, casual.  Great food and great people.
