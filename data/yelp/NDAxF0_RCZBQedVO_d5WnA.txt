This is take out only.  They have at least two locations that I am aware of.  One in Sun Prairie and one in Fitchburg.  They have excellent Chinese food and the prices are pretty good.

Best chinese I've found so far. Hot and sour soup and their won ton soup are fantastic. Sometimes I'll go and just get the soup.

I haven't had better Crab Rangoon than they serve here.  The people who work there are pretty nice, too.

The general tso's and boneless spare ribs are about as good as you'll find. No lie!

Meh. It's okay when you want something quick. Not overly impressed. Fried rice is good.

Pretty bland for Chinese take out.

We used to go here for our Americanized Chinese food every so often for the last 7 years.  However, in the last year the quality of their food has taken a nose dive to unacceptable levels of blech and blah.

The rice and steamed vegetables were good, but that's about all we could tolerate. We ordered General Tso's, which is what we always get when we first try a Chinese restaurant. It helps us compare to other places.The quality of the chicken used was awful. The dumplings were flavorless. We will not be returning.
