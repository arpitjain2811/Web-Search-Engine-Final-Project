This place is awesome! The coffee is fantastic. The staff is super friendly, they have comfy seating, plenty of room and free wi-fi. You're made to feel comfortable like it's your neighborhood cafe even if you're a first timer. The service is wonderful here. I plan to keep coming back any time I'm in the area, I wish they had a better location, though. It's the perfect place to wait and enjoy some R&R if you're picking someone up from the airport and really it's just a fantastic little place all together.

Perfectly relaxing ambiance with artistic decor. Friendly staff. Tasty food (had the delicious Turkey BLT today). Wonderfully balance cup of cafe latte (soy and vanilla flavor available). They also have a drive-thru option if you're in a hurry.

I have come here twice, the first time I came here I got a blended coffee drink that wasn't terrible but wasn't memorable either... then the next time I came I got a sandwich that was pretty good but I could of made the same thing at home.... the staff is friendly though.. but I won't be going back....

I purchased the Yelp deal and wasn't able to use it; none of the staff even knew about it. It wasn't a huge deal at the time (though it really would have been nice to use!), but I will be pretty upset if it expires.

The staff sucks beyond rude. Shouldn't be in business. Don't know how to make drinks. Don't waste your time or money going to this place. The nut job lady in the morning needs to be on meds.
