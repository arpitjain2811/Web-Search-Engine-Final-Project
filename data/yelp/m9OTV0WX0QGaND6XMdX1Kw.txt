I was in desperate need of a new phone and a new carrier, so I stopped in on my way to the grocery store.  I am so happy that I did. I now have a phone that works and I got awesome customer service.  Daniella was very nice and extremely helpful with getting my contacts transferred from my old crappy phone. She went above and beyond and even got my rebate paperwork ready for me to mail! It was just a pleasant experience overall. I would definitely recommend this store!

This verizon store is amazing. Mitchell and Barrett were so nice and very informative!  They were quick, knowledgable, and kind. This was probably my first good experience with Verizon ! Thank you very much. It is my go to store now!
