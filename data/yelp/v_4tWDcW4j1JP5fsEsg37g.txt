Not very impressed both with service and food. Although quite expensive we were very disappointed in our food we received , platters are not worth the money as you could hardly share it as very low on portions , waited nearly 40 mins for main course and we had to go to bar to get our own drinks as server was that bad , only good point is we paid for food with Tesco clubcard vouchers.
