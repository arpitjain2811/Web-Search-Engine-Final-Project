I've been to coin-op laundry places before.  I know what to expect.  I didn't expect what I saw at this place. I arrived at about 6:15PM.  The sign said last wash should occur at 6:30PM.  Even still, after I had started my loads the lady came by and was asking when I would be done and whatnot.  LEAVE ME ALONE LADY.  I know you want to go home, I understand, but I did nothing wrong. The place is filthier than most laundromats.  A difficult task to accomplish. The worst part about this place is the amount of broken machines.  More than half the driers are out of service.  More than a third of the washers are out of service.  Stuff brakes, I understand.  However....besides rent, the main operating cost is servicing the machines.  Why is this not a priority with these people?

Low reviews for the broken machines I understand, however, I use this place as a drop off laundry service and they are good. They turn around clothing in about a day and charge a dollar a pound or so.  No complaints, friendly staff
