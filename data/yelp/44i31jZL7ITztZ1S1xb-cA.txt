How can you go wrong with a place that has an old fashioned barber pole, friendly staff, AND a wacky wild inflatable tube guy:)

Great classic barber shop with attention to detail. Warning - the shop is actually a little to the west of where Google maps places it - not directly next to the Palace station but on the south side of Sahara a little further away from the strip. Open T-S and best to call for an appointment - if it's a dead afternoon they might close up early.

This barber shop is Great!  I have a flat top and Steve does a Super job.  I've had several different barbers and hairstylists over the years, and I have been told on many occasions that flat tops are a really difficult haircut.  I won't need to ever go anywhere else in the future!!
