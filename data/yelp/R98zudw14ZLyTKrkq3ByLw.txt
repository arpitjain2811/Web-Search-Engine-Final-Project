Went on Tuesday 23rd and was blown away with the quality and taste. It's the best Thai food I've had this year.

The Port of Siam is always busy, and I certainly would have been more often, were it not for the fact that I'm rarely organised enough to book a table. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that it's small. Really small. But, this is also a huge plus. With only a few tables and a couple of staff, you get the sense that you're really being looked after, and that each dish is something special (rather than one of a number being churned out by a huge kitchen). The food itself is excellent. Fresh, high quality ingredients are combined in a way that allows the individual flavours to shine through. Even the spicier dishes are delicate and quite distinct - there's no generic Thai spice here. Seafood seems to be a bit of a speciality - which is fair enough, given the location and style - so fish-lovers will definitely have the best choice. Fortunately, that's me, so it's the full five stars!

My partner and I's favourite restaurant in Edinburgh- best That food we've had outside of Thailand. It's a small restaurant so book ahead but well worth a visit, good value for the quality on show.

So we came here unsure what to expect, but we were craving some Thai so we went for it. It was great! Reminded us of being back home. The best part is that on the menu it says "if you don't see your favorite dish, please ask" I did just that and both dishes were available to make! They knock it out for sure!
