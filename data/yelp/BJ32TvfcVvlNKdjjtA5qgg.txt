Silva is the best thing that has happened to nails!  She is so meticulous and takes her time with every inch of you nails leaving you with perfectly manicured nails and feet.  If you're looking for a half finished, 15 minute job, don't go to Silva.  She's all about taking her time and leaving you nothing less than perfect results.  She is also on top of the latest fashion and trends and always carries wonderful products, such as the new Shelac which lasted me over 3 weeks without a chip!  I HIGHLY recommend Silva!!!

I have known Silva for 15+ years and she has expertly taken care of my nails during all of that time. She is an educated nail technician who stays current on all things nails, and that which can affect them. Silva is methodical and meticulous -- an absolute perfectionist. I have never had a better experience or manicure and pedicure in any other salon than the one she provides. And on top of all of that, Silva is the kindest, sweetest, most caring woman you will ever meet. If you have natural nails and want the very best, you cannot go wrong with Silva! I adore her and I think you will too.
