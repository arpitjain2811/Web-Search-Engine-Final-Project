Great place lots of options for pedicures all include mini massages and scrubs and everyone is very nice. One girl actually recommend some nail colors I didn't consider before but it turned out great and still within the theme I wanted. Mainly tho I come for the pedis they have citrus, pumpkin, yogurt, and a milk and honey one to name a few they all sound so luxurious! Definitely recommend
