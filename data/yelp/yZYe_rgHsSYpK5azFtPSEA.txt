Love scottsdale quarter and this store by far has the best semi annual sale selection. Organized, clean and I got wall flowers for $2 refills what a huge reflection will be back! A great asset to the shopping center!

It's a nice store but too much for me.    All the people are really nice and helpful.

love this store. stuff can be expensive though. love the big sales they have during the summer! the store always smells good which is good (not strong like hollister at all!). store could be bigger but its fine for what they have inside. employees can be somewhat annoying by asking you a lot if you need help or anything like that. besides that though they are always nice and always have a smile on their face.
