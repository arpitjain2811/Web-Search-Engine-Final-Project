I love dollar tree, I always find a bunch of stuff that I didn't know I needed O_o   I usually go in there with only a certian amount of $$.  And usually, I'm  leaving stuff at the counter. This place is way better than the place that cost  1 cents less!

A quick and easy stop to pick up all the basics for any house party. The basics such as utensils, plates, napkins, cups, and decoration are inexpensive. Some of the items are on the cheesy side, but you get what you pay for.

Good for a few things, it is a dollar store so what do you expect.
