Great customer service,

This place is awful. They will tell you they have stuff then charge you an admission to enter and find out they dont have what your looking for. The "manager" Lawrence provided me the poorest example of customer service i have ever had. The guy is not fit to work anywhere where human interaction is a part of the job. The prices were decent but I'd rather pay double than deal with them again. If you check out their google review you'll see im not the first with this exact complaint.

It would had been nice if pick n pull left a message letting us no there no more pick n pull in AZ. N closes one to us is in fresono, CA.
