I eat here because I work down the street, I like this mexican food more than any other place like it. It's just very good and authentic tasting. I have had many friends come with me to this place and they agree, the food is very very good and is better than any other place like it.

A couple girls from work get takeout from Los Favoritos multiple times a week. I was invited in on one of their lunches one Saturday and have been hooked since. Everyone is always very friendly and the food is always delicious. Keep it up!
