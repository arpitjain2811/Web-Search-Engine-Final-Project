While looking up Christmas Light displays on the internet I stumbled across this.....and WOW! If you are looking to see some Christmas lights this is the place to go. Beautifully decorated with some of the most amazing displays I have ever seen! Children absolutely love it....even our newborn daughter was amazed. It runs till December 31st.

Outstanding place to go to during Christmas for the light display and during the  Easter Pageant. Amazing place to be any day of the year actually. Visitors center is highly helpful for people who are not familiar of the Latter-Day Saint Faith.
