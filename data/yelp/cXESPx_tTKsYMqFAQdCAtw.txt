Great office and staff! My 7 yr old son had been going to the Surprise location since he was 3. We recently moved to the north phoenix area so we were glad knowing that WVPD had a location nearby. My son just enjoys going to the dentist. They really make it very pleasant and fun for children of all ages.

Great doctor, my child loves him. Very patient and professional. Will be back again and again. Tara, the office manager is helpful and sweet, rare and so nice to see.
