I loved this place! It's true here some things cost more than they do IN Mexico. But, hey I got to save all that gas money or airfare by not having to cross the border.  I bought plates here. As well as crosses for my hyper-religious family.  All bases covered artfully and colorfully! Excellent! I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the Phoenix area!

This is a great place to get Mexican handicrafts at a very reasonable price and they have a nice selection.
