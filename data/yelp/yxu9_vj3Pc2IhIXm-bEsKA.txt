In July 2012 I rode in a Yellow-Checker-Star taxi and was told by the driver that this was "the elite fleet" for locals in Las Vegas. Now that I am a local in Las Vegas, I find that this taxi company is not "elite" at all. I would honestly suggest avoiding using YCS Transportation whether you are a local in Las Vegas or a visitor. The reason: You can wait forever a never get a cab after you call. The people who take the calls sound exasperated and helpless.
