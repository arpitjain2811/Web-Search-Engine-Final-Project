This is a cute little shop with a variety of non-essential knick knacks and other various gift shop items. Overpriced, but in line with what you would expect with other strip offerings. This is a cute little shop to wander through while you're enjoying everything the Linq has to offer.  Definitely check out the accessories wall, but it's definitely geared towards tourists.

YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(127/365) "Hot Topics' Cousin" Located in the Linq, this kitschy little shop has alot of silly trinkets, toys, gadgets, and other nonsense that one would be crazy to pay for. I thought the Pot Holders were hilarious... Its good to just take a peek, have a good laugh and that's just about it...kinda reminds  me of a wannabe Hot Topic.The workers there were very courteous even though I wasn't planning on getting anything...ALOHA!!!
