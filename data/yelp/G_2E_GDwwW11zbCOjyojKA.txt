This was the best automobile mechanic experience I've ever had. It was amazing how honest this team was... and reasonable. I was a referral from a couple trusted people myself and since, have referred a couple more to Import Auto Pros. Thank you!!! I will be seeing you twice a year forever and ever!

Outstanding shop. Very thorough, very honest, show you what they are doing and why. Very reasonable cost for diagnostics. I was referred here by my previous mechanic, since I now have a vehicle that is outside their specialty area.

I have used Import Auto Pros twice now and It doesn't get any better. They are honest and very good mechanics. If something was found after the quote they call to let you know. They are the best in the buisness.

Found this shop on the Car Talk website when I was looking to bring my Honda CRV somewhere other than the dealer.  Have not been disappointed. They do excellent work and are reasonably priced. I'm thrilled to have found them.

This team of guys know what they are doing and are HONEST.  I have been using Import Auto Pros for the past 10 years for my personal cars and now the business fleet where I work is under their care.  Great customer service... this really is as good as it gets.  They even take the time to explain what is NEEDED NOW and CAN WAIT; in terms a girl can understand!  Thanks, Mark, Mike, Bruce and Steve
