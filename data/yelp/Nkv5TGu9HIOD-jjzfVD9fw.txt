We came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The diner was small with limited seating. The wait staff has to squeeze between chairs to wait tables. The food is country style and is delicious. They have a few unique dishes. After a short while, vintage cars began parking out front. This is a weekly breakfast group that drives these classics to the diner every Sunday. If you don't mind tight quarters, it's worth checking out.

Great neighborhood location.  Small, friendly, good food and service.  Not a spacious but adequate.  Many basic homemade specality items.  If you have the time to enjoy the visit  it is a great place to visit
