Burger was good.  Fries were good. Soda was good. FROSTY was AMAZING. for a cheeseburger combo it is $5.95. To upgrade to large it's a dollar.  Frosty's are $3 for a small.  They don't charge you extra for BBQ sauce.  This place saved my stomach (strangely enough) I was hungover and the burger and fries literally kept me from dry heaving. Thank you wendy's.

WOW- the prices almost made me pass out. I like Wendy's though, and I was hungry, so it had to do.  Enjoyable food, clean food court, but way too expensive to want to come back.

$10.58 for a medium-sized chicken sandwich meal. Not very good, but one of the few places open at 2am on a Wednesday night :-(
