I'm a big fan of FIB'S - Fine Italian Beef.  The food is great and the cart brings back memories of time spent in Chicago.  The meatball sub is the best I've ever had and a fellow worker, who's a professed chili hot dog expert says that FIB'S chili dog is the best she's had. I recently found out that the owner of the cart donates to local homeless shelters quite often.  Wonderful !

Very beautiful area with 8+ food trucks during the lunch rush and lots of benches to enjoy your food on! Surrounded by lovely gothic architecture to look at and tall trees providing shade....it can be a really serene place to relax. Of course sometimes there are events going on here and a random hardcore religious advocate shouting at the crowd.
