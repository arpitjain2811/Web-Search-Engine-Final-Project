Over staffed, but there is never anyone to help me look at something I am potentially going to buy. No bargaining whatsoever, not even if the item has been there forever.

This place is overstaffed, and in fact right when you walk in there is no warm welcome to the store. Everyone who works there is busy. Sadly my experience here was dissapointing because they didn't have what I was looking for.  The store seems to be under construction. There was a bum in the music section just playing his little heart out on the piano, all intoxicated. (felt uncomfy) There is no variety of product. Service is poor.

Called about a guitar.  Was on hold for over 5 minutes.  Called back and the gal hung up on me.  Called back again asking why the rude service, was told they don't have the guitar I was inquiring about.  Probably the first time in my life as a 50 year old man that I was treated this poorly.

EZ Pawn is a very trustworthy establishment.  I found a piece of art for sale on-line and EZ Pawn staff assisted me through the entire process.  Their staff returned my calls and emails on-time, completed the transaction on the phone, and assisted me getting the art piece delivered safely to my home in California.   I am a very happy customer and I look forward to working with EZ Pawn again!
