Delicious breads, sweet rolls, and now SOUP for lunch too!

I love this little local hometown bakery. I love stopping and getting a coffee and cream cheese danish.  My husband loves their cinnamon rolls.  The molasses cookies are soft and chewy.  I recommend trying it all!

This is a special hometown place to go. The best coffee, baked goods and chit chat. Owners are hard working and very friendly. I stop in at a minimum of twice a week. Love it.
