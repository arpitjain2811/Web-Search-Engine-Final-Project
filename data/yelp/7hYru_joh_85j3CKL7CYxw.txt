Its starbucks! Its friendly, has a consistent taste anywhere you go and free wifi! And a starbucks in a shopping mall is one of the best things! After a few hours of shopping, and trying on too many things that don't fit or make you look fat, its just perfect to get a nice latte and relax! There is plenty of seating and there is even a roped off section in the mall (outside the store) for starbucks only seating!  I love my starbucks so really I'm always happy to see one around!

I'm a Caff√® Nero fan myself (I have a few months supply of their beans at home), however, needs must when nowt is around. I had a Triple Espresso using their Ethiopian Blend as I wanted it ASAP (as STRONG as possible). It did not disappoint. I also chose an "All day breakfast bap". This was ok and filled a gap, but, that's it really. Pleasant service. Indoor & outdoor seating.
