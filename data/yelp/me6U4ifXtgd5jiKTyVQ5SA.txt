Carne Asada fries! Open 24hrs and never too packed! Minus 1 star cause they got no Mexican Cokes!

Never crowded, service is quick and efficient. Food is typical Roberto's. Love their enchaladas and rellanos.

Service is quick and the food is delicious. I frequent this place for lunch. The burritos tend to be a little on the sloppy side, but that's just because they're incredibly juicy and extremely packed inside, so I'm certainly not complaining about it. Biggest tip: There is a small cart on the back wall with many side items that you can place into provided baggies. I *highly* recommend the spicy carrots. No extra charge!
