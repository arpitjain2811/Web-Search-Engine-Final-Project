Pizza sauce and crust was flat with no taste. Owners were not very friendly.

With having three kids in the house we differently eat a lot of pizza. By far the best pizza I have had in the area. We moved in a couple blocks away and this will for sure be a walking distance dinner spot for us. Oh and the wings amazing. First place I have asked for extra crispy and they understood what I meant!!! Loved it! And the fact that its family owned and they are super nice just made it even better.
