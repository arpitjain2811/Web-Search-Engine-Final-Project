SERRV has incredible, hand-crafted, fairly-traded items ranging from clothing to hand-woven baskets to linens. Most recently I stopped in and checked out the gorgeous baskets which range in size and are all very unique.  It's a super cool non-profit org that supports communities around the world and works to eradicate poverty. Awesome place to shop and support a good cause while doin' it.
