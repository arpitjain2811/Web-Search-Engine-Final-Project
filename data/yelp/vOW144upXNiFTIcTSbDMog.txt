Gas is expensive but where can you find cheap gas now a days. Great customer service with everyone that works there. Will talk and chat and if they know you they tend to know what you want. Great place.

If you're in the mood, the coffee brewed here isn't too bad!! Good selection of snacks, (Beef Jerky, Chips, Donuts, Candy.) If you like to play slots, they always offer you a drink or free snack. They have both Coke and Pepsi products for fountain drinks, which is nice! Personally, I've always had good service at this Speedee Mart location...

This has been my quick stop store for a number of years as it's right across the street from where I live. It's always been quick and friendly. A great corner store.
