Wonderful pizza at good prices. Ask for current specials. Yummy pizza varieties, especially the chicken bacon ranch. Monona Italian delivers deliciousness once again!

These folks really care about their pizza. If you don't know subtle flavoring on a pizza, it's possible here. Try walking in to order your pizza--it's an education.

Ok pizza. I like Glass Nickel a little better, but this is pretty good. Great delivery service (fast). This is on Monona drive. The address on Yelp is their old address.
