This location is quick and always friendly. I've never had a bad experience with the staff or the food. Great location and easy to get in and out of.  When you're craving something fast on the way home, this is the way to go!

I rarely go into Taco Bell, but had to try the new Stuft Nacho thing they invented. The commercials always get me to try the new stuff that fast food chains are rolling out. It has a strange triangular shape and clearly tastes likes nachos all wrapped up in that tortilla, but near the end it gets messy and your thinking, "why did I order this" instead of just getting real nachos.It's only 2 bucks and the chips are inside, but they are tortilla strips and everything else in there has been seen before. It's creative, but falls short of being something that you need to eat more than once.

Got food poisoning from here. Confirmed.  All fluids exploding out of both ends requiring me to keep drinking water and fueling the mayhem. Never again.
