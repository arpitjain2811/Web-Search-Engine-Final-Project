Great place! I loved the intimate atmosphere, not like your big salons on the strip but you get the same quality. Prices are reasonable. I had a shampoo and blow out from Misty and have already scheduled an appointment for color.

Misty Silverman [ (702) 927-7386 ] is awesome! Great cuts. Everything was even and healthy without taking off too much. She put in beautiful high and low lights all over they look fantastic! Very reasonably priced also!

The Saturday hours are wrong?! What are your hours? And why no answering machine when you call?

I love going to Lo to get my hair touched up when I'm in town. She does great cut and color at great prices and it's always a pleasure to chit chat with!
