I used Rose's Dog Grooming a few times and was happy with my experience.  She seems pretty busy.  You have to call quite a bit in advance for an appt.  At the beginning of the summer I got my dogs hair cut short and it took several months to grow in.  When I took her back to get groomed Rose checked her file (index card) and because it had "been awhile" since her last groom she charged me extra $$.  My dog was not matted or even dirty so there was no reason for an extra charge.  I always bring my dog in when she needs a groom and in between she gets baths and trims at the vet when I take her for checkups.  The extra charge really turned me off and I haven't been back since.

I've been going here for about 3 years and am very happy. Rosie loves the dogs as if they were her own and my dog comes home looking great every time. I couldn't be happier to have finally found a place in Vegas where the quality of the job is consistent and the prices are reasonable.
