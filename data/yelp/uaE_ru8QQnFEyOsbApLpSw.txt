Very nice Bingo room, brand new, has a bar and vending machines for snacks. Smoking section is glass walled off which is nice.

The GVR Bingo room can best be described as a mini Red Rock.  It's very modern with a separate clear glass enclosed section just for smokers so you can make funny faces and throw things at the wall lol The opening week was rough, the staff was getting settled and some of the players seemed to have never played bingo before, seriously I counted 5 times where someone called bingo and didn't have anything.  The low-point was during cover all and someone yelled bingo and the called said "Sir- I haven't even called enough numbers to have a bingo yet". Weeks later the room runs much smoother and the players seem to have learned the rules.  Will it ever be as fun and full of energy like Red Rock? Maybe not, but it's still fun!

Love this bingo room!! I love the fact that you have a separate room for the smokers. It makes it easier to breathe. But also the employees are very friendly! Around the 7 and 9pm sessions it came become a little busy. That is when they and the double/triple pay. But overall a nice room!  P.S. Go for the tan card - higher pay! :)
