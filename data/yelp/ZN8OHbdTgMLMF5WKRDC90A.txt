Dr Freedman saved my Marriage. My husband had a heart attack which Contributed to his Erectile Dysfunction. Dr Freedman suggested a Penile Implant by Coloplast. I was all for it but my Husband was a little reluctant. Dr Freedman suggested he talk to a patient who has a penile implant. After they spoke about the procedure my Husband was all for it.  My Husbands self esteem has returned and we are enjoying the results. I am truly indepted to Dr Freedman and his staff for Saving my marriage.
