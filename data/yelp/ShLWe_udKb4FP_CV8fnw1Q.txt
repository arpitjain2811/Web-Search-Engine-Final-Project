If your in the mood for great soup and sandwiches and desserts that are as good as any I have ever had, then your in luck. Cafe Zupas won't let you down. Give them a try. They are super friendly despite being opening week.

Super nice service, delicious food, fresh ingredients.  Doesn't get any better than that.  The sandwiches are a bit on the small side but it gets the job done and fills you up pretty good, especially if you get their combo - two of a full size sandwich, half soup or half salad.

Great concept, great service, great soups and salads but was not impressed with the sandwich my wife got.  Everything is pre-done to make things roll quickly.  It is a Chipotle style restaurant that you order as you go down the line and pay at the end.  The variety was awesome but the sandwich was a little soggy by the time we got to eat it.  The place is large and super casual but very bright and lots of fun for the kids too.  Will come back for sure to try more soups and salads.

The set up was cool here! Very bright and energetic. The employees are nice.  I ordered a chicken chop salad and the chicken enchilada soup combo. It was tasty. Fresh.  I also tried my friends lobster soup. It was too fishy for me.
