Simply put, my favorite lunch destination in Arizona. AppleCafe offers delicious wraps, salads, burgers, and breakfast served all day! They are also well-known for their amazing smoothies. The food is fresh, hot and generally very healthy.  I always order a wrap, and my favorite would be The Big Daddy (egg, cheese, potato) but I have never had a bad experience.  There is ample parking. The interior features indoor/outdoor seating with two TVs usually tuned to ESPN News. The decorum celebrates the owner's NYC roots which inspired the name (i.e. The Big Apple). FYI, it closes at 7 pm, but offers $1 longnecks during Happy Hour. This is a great spot! Check it out, and you'll thank me.

This place is amazing,  i am a big fan of their sandwiches, i would recommend trying the "HAMPTON" . I'm not sure if those guys sold the place or changed it, but i would say you should stop by and check them out!
