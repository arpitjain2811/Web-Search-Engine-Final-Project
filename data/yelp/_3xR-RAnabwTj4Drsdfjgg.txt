Love love love BR mint chocolate chip ice-cream! The girl working today was the nicest girl ever. Super friendly and upbeat. She offered us a few taste samples.  We sampled the "Flavor of the Month", the sorbet mix, and the mocha-java.  Definitely made our experience even better. Nothing better than ice-cream when it's 110 outside - no exaggeration. If you are heading south on Power - You can enter this location by turning left at the light and make a quick right cutting through the gas station.  Easier than doing a U-Turn on this busy road.

Who doesn't love ice cream?  Nothing special about Baskin-Robbins except the workers are very nice at this location.  Always a good place to stop by after getting gas
