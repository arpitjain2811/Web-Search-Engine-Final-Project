The closest UPS store to my house which is awesome if I ever have to send anything via UPS. The store itself has PO Box rentals to if you need but mainly used for anything UPS related.  Nothing really to exciting going on here but, then again, what do you expect from the UPS store? LOL

close to house, use them mostly for notary service. $5 seems like a good deal.

Really hard to give a glorified post office less then 5 stars unless one of the staff members throws a pair of ninja scissors at me! 5 stars for service and clean enviroment. Will come back for more letter mailing action!

Staff is always helpful. I would much rather go here than the US post office. Every time I go in someone jumps to help and answer any question I may have and always friendly. I hate parking though - Its right next to Smith's so thru traffic is always a pain.

So much cheaper than FedEx/Kinkos, easier, nicer, and much faster! I spent $25 here vs. $80 there for the same prints!!! Crazy!

Owners are total asswipes. [David & Matthew McGovern].. They overcharge on all their services cost of mailboxes. USPS, charges $64.00, semi annually. These guys charge nearly three times that amount. A total rip off. And it's a nightmare with them as far as forwarding your mail. It's NOT ALLOWED FROM A UPS STORE SUPRISE? I would never trust these crooks!
