I drove half way across the valley to find Cutting Edge Hobbies in hopes of buying some supplies/kits for model rockets.  I was disappointed to find that they do not carry much on that front.  It took me about 30 seconds to walk around the entire shop.  Yes, it is that small.  There were some R/C car supplies.  Maybe some paints.  And some paintball supplies.  Not much else that sparked my interest.   The guy working the counter was kind enough to ask what I was searching for and honest enough to tell me they did not carry such items.  I will not return to this store.  Not because it is a bad store.  It doesn't seem to be.  It just doesn't have much and nothing that I am interested in.  Lesson learned.

a small but good shop, call ahead to see if they have what you need first since it is a small shop.  Great for RC stuff.  They guys there are knowledgeable, helpful and friendly.
