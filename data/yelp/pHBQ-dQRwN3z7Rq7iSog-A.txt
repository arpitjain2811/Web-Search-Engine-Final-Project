Note: I have only ordered delivery, and that I've ordered online. That said, the pizza we've gotten from here has been consistently fresh, hot, and tasty. I think there's only been one time that I was disappointed with the consistency of the dough, hence three stars instead of four.

Craving a thin crust Pizza Hut pizza last night I called this place at 8PM for a delivery..They were out of pizza,yes out of thin crust pizza...I said that's like McDonalds being out of cheeseburgers,and was hung up on!? Unbelievable!

In a world where money buys you food--why would you come here and buy cardboard?   Pizza Hut in general has gone downhill so far, it's not even funny.  I remember when I was a kid in the early 80's, Pizza Hut was awesome.  Now, it's all horrible.

Cheese sticks were under cooked, the pizza was EXTREMELY greasy.  I mean, oil was literally dripping out of the crust. Gross. It also had kind of a funky aftertaste. Wings were okay.  With so many options for good pizza in town, there is pretty much no reason to eat at pizza hut, even if it does save you a few bucks. Boo-urns.
