3 hrs for a SmartCar oil change?! Outrageous. I even had to cancel the complimentary car wash I waited so long. And don't expect to get good AT&T or Verizon service in the wait area. The SA was very nice, but came out 3 different times to upsell what totaled $1700 in repairs (for a $9000 vehicle!). Very nice customer service and waiting area, but its tough to give more than 2 stars when a simple oil change took more than twice as long as the 1 1/2 hrs they told me to expect.

I just wanted to test drive a Smart Car. I was walking around for like ten minutes and nobody helped me. If you want service, you have to go into the Mercedes dealership attached to the Smart Car dealership. Once I did get served though, they were really nice.
