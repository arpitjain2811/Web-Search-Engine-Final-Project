I only been here once but they have EVERYTHING you need for a great set of nails and the prices are pretty reasonable. The service was good and they are very helpful and quite friendly.  I love this store!

Service was horrible, there  was one man in the store and he kept following me through the isles. I'm pretty sure he thought I was going to steal something. I didn't find that their prices were reasonable. I paid $15 for hemp lotion and $8 for nail polish. Hmmmmm not sure if I'll be coming here again.

Nothing is more annoying than a overly packed store. The isles were packed and they had boxes all along the floor. You literally have to watch your step to make sure you don't fall over.  It looked like they had lots a great stuff but I lost my patience after 5 minutes or so.
