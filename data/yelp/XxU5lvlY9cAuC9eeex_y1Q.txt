Had bought watch from other store, and was told had to check with company store to see if they could order extra link, went in to store with hopes of ordering link and having sent to my home in southern Illinois, but Dory was very helpful and looked threw links they had extra and found one that was exact match after she installed, she smiled and said there was no charge, I will return any time I need something for my watch and if I ever have to replace I will definatly return and buy from this place. vary happy customer Al Martin  Mt.

Very friendly and helpful sales staff. I was having a watch band adjusted, and nothing more, but I would come back after the very friendly service I received.
