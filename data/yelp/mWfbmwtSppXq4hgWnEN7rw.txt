They have horrible costumer service.  They did not send me all of the items i ordered on their online store.  I tried for several weeks to get it resolved by calling them and emailing them but nobody got back to me.  Apparently they must have shot each other in the face.

Vee is wonderful!!! Works hard at getting you your order fast and efficiently. If something is on backorder they'll let you know either on the site or by email once you order it. Also, I've visited hq and it is awesome!!!! Store up front and training in the back. Very friendly and courteous folks. Happy to be a part of the team! X2499 out!
