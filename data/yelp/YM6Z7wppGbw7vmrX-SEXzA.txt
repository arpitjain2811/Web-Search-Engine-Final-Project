Sunset shutters gets zero stars. This place is bullshit. Ordered and paid for custom shutters in December. It's April and still no effing shutters. They have made several appointments to install, but have stood us up. Unprofessional, inconsiderate. Cannot recommend. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY...bastards...We dealt with a person named Alvaro Ramirez....our attorneys will handle from here...

I have used Sunset Shutters for my clients and everyone has been extremely happy with the results.  Their products are exceptional and their client service has also been excellent.  They have delivered on time and their installations have been very professional.  I would not hesitate to recommend them.
