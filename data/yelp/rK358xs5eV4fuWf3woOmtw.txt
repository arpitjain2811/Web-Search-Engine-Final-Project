There's no sound on any of the TV's for any of the games.  Barely any waitress service and no table side service for food.  If you want you can go wait in the long line at the deli and then wait some *more* while the make your food and call your number.

It's open 24/7 and they have the football etc on one side and the horse racing on the other. Which I think works well for both of the books.
