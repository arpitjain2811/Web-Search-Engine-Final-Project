It was our second time ordering.. Our first pizza was good, it could have used more sauce, so this time around I just ordered more sauce, the house salad is soo good too!!  Its big enough for two people!

This place is good. I was skeptical at first but once i took a bite of my pizza i was delighted. The dough is so soft, and delicious. The cheese and pepperoni was perfect, put in enough sauce, i do not like a lot of sauce just enough to taste it. We got a large pizza and 8 wings plus a 2 ltr soda all for 14 and change. Good price, the wings were nice and hot as well.
