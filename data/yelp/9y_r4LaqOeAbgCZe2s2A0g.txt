Chill and relaxed. Loads of vintage equipment; guitars, amps, basses, and a small drum equipment section. Donny is the owner and the guitar technician.

Great place for instrument repairs and buying used instruments. Whether it's a guitar or amp repair, the owner is always willing to take a look at you broken instruments. There are some real gems for sale in the store pretty often too!

So, I've been going here for a year and my guitars have never sounded better.   Donny gives great advice and is one guy that goes out of his way to help musicians - his philosophy and customer service are outstanding.  His collection of vintage amps are likewise impressive - plus the place is next to Nami!
