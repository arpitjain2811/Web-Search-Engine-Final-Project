Came here for some basic maintenance, but they do everything here from basic bodywork, wheels and tires, upgrades and performance parts. The prices are very reasonable, and the service is usually pretty fast and friendly! It's not too far from the strip either...so if you need some unexpected work done while you are in town, give them a call and see if it makes sense!

Came here about 5 months ago to get my Vw Gti tuned and a few parts installed.  Nothing but great service, great prices, quality work.  This place stood out from all the other Vw shops in Vegas because they're the only Unitronic dealer in town.  I come here now for all my maintenance work.  I highly recommend this place. Shout out to (Wayne, Omar, Sal)

Called inbto price out oil changes for a 2005 lexus is300(synthetic oil). The price was well under Jiffy lube, so I was convinced. The gentleman explained that he didnt have the oil filter on hand but could get it by the time I showed up. I took that chance. I got in to find out that the oil filter hadn't arrived but I wasn't mad since it showed up only minutes after. Overall I had a good eperience. They were very nice and seemed to know what they were doing. The only other compaint I had is that the waiting area was cold (im just being picky) Definite recommendation here!
