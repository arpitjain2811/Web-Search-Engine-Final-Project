Wanted to check out the surrounding area from my job and see what type of retail stores we had other that the Wal Mart, and I found Ross, and I haven't been to this Ross, so I wondered on over during my lunch hour to check them out. The store was clean; no clothes in the isle and it appeared very neat and organized.  I went with the intention of only window shopping and scouting the place out, but I saw they had some cute dressed I could wear to work, so I wound up shopping haha.  Also checked out the fitting room and they also were clean and no clothes littering the floor. Scored 3 dresses & a shoulder wrap for under 60 bucks, so that's a win for me!   I do see me coming back to this Ross

Everywhere i go to make a return or exchange I have to wait.  All businesses are more interested in making money, not returning it.  Ha!
