Most unique pet store you will find! In a busy retail shopping center, but it feels like a warehouse inside. Everything in the store is about half the price you will find in any other local pet store. Great staff and dogs are welcome. 6 Stars if I could do it...

Awesome prices! Bought 2 Tuffy Dinosaurs the T-Rex and a pig and a big kong for less than $60! In CA I bought one Tuffy Triceratops and that alone was about $60. What can I say my dog is well loved. Friendly customer service and I wish them luck!

I will be back that is for sure. The selection of toys is EXCELLENT and so were the prices.  My puppy fell in love with his new toys and bed. The staff was very friendly and helpful when I asked for advice on a particular type of toy I was looking for.

This place is awesome. I saw this place when driving and went in to check it out. HUGE selection of dog supplies at much cheaper prices than Petsmart and Petco. Aisles with shelves full of chew toys and treats and they also sell crates, beds, strollers, harnesses, leashes, and grooming supplies. Amazing prices. My dog is an aggressive chewer and can go through toys in 10 minutes so I stocked up on Kongs, Nylabones, and other durable toys as well as some treats for $25. I would have spent twice that at other pet supply stores. Check this place out for all your dog needs.

This place is the best. They carry all the dog food brands that I would deem as much healthier (and more costly) but here they have the cheapest price I have found in town by far and even online! Super friendly and helpful staff, tons of toys/treats and other dog supplies. Must faster too than waiting for that online order to ship out to you.
