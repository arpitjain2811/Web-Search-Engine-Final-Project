I called and made an appointment for myself and my sister since my husband gave us gift cards for their V.I.P and Luxury spa packages. I double checked the appointment and we went there and were told it wasn't written down and I was basically ignored by the owner and when I told him we could not come back basically told I was trying to get a refund on someone else's money. Had my husband come up there and he was told no refund even though five minutes before he offered my sister not me even though I was the only one talking a refund if he could take five dollars off of each gift card. Really This is how you do business and you ignore the person talking and call her honey in a condescending tone. Will never do business there again.

Love this place! I've been going for a few months now And can't quite see myself Going anywhere else. Simply awesome. The owner guy, I think he thinks I'm crazy, but I like trying new things and I think my nail tech likes my Unpredictability, she always giggles and is a great sport. She does amazing work, and I highly suggest making an appointment, it's worth it!!!
