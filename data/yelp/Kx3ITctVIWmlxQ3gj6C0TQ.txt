Cool place

I had no problem with customer service as Jesse P. has mentioned. The workers were actually very nice & friendly to me. They have everything from feed to clothing. I thought the clothing, while appearing to be of good quality, was a bit pricey. They even have chicks for sale at $2.99 each. They are very cute, but make sure you use the hand sanitizer provided after if you pet them! I will shop here again!

Their staff is always helpful and friendly.  Great prices on western and workwear.  Had adequate supplies of ammo this summer where other places were cleaned out.

Great country store. You can get your jeans and ammo here. Brent & Wayne will take great care of you over at the gun counter.
