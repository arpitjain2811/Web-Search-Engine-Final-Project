Having never tried acupuncture before, I came to Hive Healing House with a terrible pain in my left shoulder. I was amazed at what a difference the treatment made! The next day I was nearly back to normal. I was hooked. I have continued to see Janelle since, and she has helped me with other issues, both physical and emotional. In addition to acupuncture, I have also tried her cupping and ear candling services - both fantastic, as well!  Janelle's kind spirit and intuition make her an excellent practitioner, and her office is welcoming and comfortable. Whether you're suffering from an injury, dealing with emotional issues, or just wanting to get centered, I highly recommend Hive Healing House!

I absolutely love the Hive Healing House and Janelle!  There is such great energy here.  I have been seeing Janelle for over a year on and off and always find great relief.  She has helped me with digestive issues, back pain, stress and relaxation.  Janelle has a very gentle and compassionate way about her.  I highly recommend the Hive Healing House.

I'm so blessed to have Janelle in my life. I have been going to her for almost 2 years once a week. I'v suffered with anxiety and panic attacks growing up. My primary would try putting me on all different medications that were highly addictive and didn't do anything for me. Janelle has maintained my anxiety with acupuncture and herbal supplements. She also helps mentor me through life itself. I truly believe she has the gift to heal. I have my dad that comes to her once a week, as well as my mom, friends and others. I will be seeing Janelle as long as I live!
