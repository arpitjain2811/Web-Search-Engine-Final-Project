Good food, very good service.  Gives one the feel of the south without going overboard...  I tend to hang out in the bar area seating even when I go there to eat... decent menu, the calimari is good....

This placed closed a while ago! When they were open, they had great happy hour hurricanes and deep fried pickles!  Regular menu seemed overly pricey.  Oh well...gone now!
