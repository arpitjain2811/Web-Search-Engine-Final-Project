This store no longer exists. Edit 11/8/10: Changed to 5 stars, Manawerx is under new ownership and is sharing a store for the time being with Imperial Outpost Games in Phoenix. Rumor is they may occupy the suite next door. More as it develops.

Ordered online on a Saturday--- Hoping to get cards in by Friday of the following week.  The shop didn't even mail them out until 3 days later on Tuesday.  I can understand Sunday, but Tuesday?  What's the point of charging for special shipping options if you aren't even going to ship next day or in a timely mannor. Good prices but now I am pretty much screwed for states because my cards won't be in on time.  Don't buy if you want them quickly.
