Nice furniture but mediocre service.  We won't be back because of the attitude but are happy with our furniture and were able to buy pieces right off the floor. The people at Thomasville and Bassett are much more friendly and give you a little more attention and are appreciative of your business.  We didn't get that feeling at Nest Featherings.

The store had a large showroom beautifully arranged with any item that may fit your decor. From lamps, chairs, tables, couches, bed frames, stools, mirrors, and even outdoor furniture on the second floor. I liked the salesperson greeted me at the door, gave me information about the lay out of the store and what it offered, then left me alone until I had made my way around the entire store, then she greeted me again, asked if I had any questions, then left me alone once more. NO pushy salespeople here. I love it.  I say if you are in the market for some unique and stylish furniture, this is the place. ( I am still house hunting and only browsing today, that's why I didn't purchase anything on this trip.)
