Been to this location once. I would come back. I ordered the NY hot dog. It's 100% beef with sauerkraut, spicy mustard and fried onions. I love sauerkraut. The service was okay. I had to tell the order taker my order a few times. And the person who brings out the food threw away my receipts so I made him dig them out the trash because he just assumed that I didn't want them. The food was hot. They didn't give me enough ketchup packets for my onion rings though. Typical fast food place with areas they can improve in with appropriate feedback.

I gave this place a 2nd chance for breakfast. Apparently, when you ask for not tomatoes you get them anyways. :-/ I'm never going back there again

This location sucks. Always takes forever, drive thru or pull in. The master blasts are never blended. Bottom half is always just plain ice cream. Worst sonic in the valley.
