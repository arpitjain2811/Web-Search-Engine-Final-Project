I have been using this law office for a little more than 5 years now, I needed immigration help and then got into an horrible accident in 2011, I used this office for both of my issues, and I'm pretty satisfied with their service.  My personal injury case was quite complicated, they filed a law suit on the case and it took a long time. The case just got closed,  and I got a pretty good settlement check at the end.

Me and my fianc√© got into an 2 accidents back to back. We switched over to this law office because our first attorney wasn't doing anything for us. When we switched to this one, our case manager Jo took her time with us and always called to update us on our case. We would definitely come back to this law office if for any reason. The only thing we didn't like was the receptionist. She should be a little more friendly and know what you're talking about because it always seems like she's either confused or doesn't know what you're talking about. Other than that, everyone else is very friendly.
