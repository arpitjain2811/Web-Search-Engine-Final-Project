Haven't had to go to a laundromat in years. Found this one via yelp today. They use a prepaid card instead of coins. Nice attendant to help with questions and keep everything clean. Glad to have found it.

Clean (2 stars) in an area of town where that's tough to find, but they use a card system. The card costs $3(!!) and the machine for cards doesn't accept quarters.  The customer service was good, until I asked if the machine takes quarters and the lady responded, you don't have cash? No, I have quarters. Geez.  Last straw? 1/3 of the machines were out if order. A sign nearby said, apologetically, "New machines coming in November." I won't come back to find out.
