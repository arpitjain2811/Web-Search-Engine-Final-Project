I am extremely happy with my new hair extensions.  Scheduling was super easy and convenient.  Installation was faster than anticipated and completely painless. Carmen is a true professional.

I visited Glam Live shortly after they opened with my 8 year old son.  He and I were desperately in need of hair cuts!!  Carmen was great!!  She did a fantastic job of getting my son to sit still and be patient while she cut his hair.  This has been a challenge in the past with other barbers/stylists.  She then cut my hair, and did an excellent job of giving me exactly the look I wanted.   My son and I both walked out looking much, much better than when we walked in!!  I'd highly recommend Glam Live Creative Studio for anyone who wants to feel better about how they look!

I love doing hair and building my own brand along with such a good team. Come experience our culture and fall in love with our style.
