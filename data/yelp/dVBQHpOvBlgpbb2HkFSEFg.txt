Not a very good store in my opinion.  The prices are about 15% higher than other stores nearby.  It's fairly clean and service is what you expect from a Walgreens.... Crappy. I can't stand the check out system of these places and others like them (CVS).  Just horrible. And the check out process is WAY too long. Avoid!!!

This has to be the most impressive WalGreens store around the west valley. It's huge and has a great selection of products.  What really stood out is their section that simulates a Circle K or Quik-Trip.  Want an ICEE?  Yup, they have an Icee machine. I even considered buying one of their gourment-type sandwiches/wraps/salad/dessert. It's a 24 store and has a very well lit cosmetics area.  I can't wait to go back!
