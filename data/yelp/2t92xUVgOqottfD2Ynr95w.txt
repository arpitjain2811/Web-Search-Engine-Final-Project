I received a light facial from Lorri and my skin looked fabulous the next day. Her room is so spacious and yet cozy and inviting. She has a great touch. I would Highly recommend.

I have been having Lorri wax and tint my brows and tint my lashes for the past 10 years.  I wouldn't go to anyone else... she does an excellent job and is extremely talented. I would recommend everyone check her out.

Had a facial and eyebrows done by Lorri yesterday. My skin look fabulous - young and hydrated. She did a "light" treatment on me and something called "fire and ice", it felt really good! I loved it!!!!
