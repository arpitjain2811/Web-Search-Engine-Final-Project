Nice cheap pizza. Sometimes there's a really long line and sometimes it's not as fresh but hey, $5 pizza. Can't be too picky.

The pizza is standard Little Caesars pizza.  Can't complain about that at $5/pizza.  The B grade from the health dept was somewhat disturbing, especially when I see a guy with a huge afro in the back making pizza without a hair net on.  Was totally surprised I didn't find a hair in my pizza.
