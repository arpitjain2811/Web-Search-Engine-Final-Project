Wow. Yummm. gimme more now. I admit I ran to the car to eat it, but anyway isn't ice cream/frozen yogurt a safe adult fantasy to be enjoyed in public? Well ...I always feel guilty about things that taste this good.

This place is pretty close to my house, a nice walk to the Southern Highlands shopping center where they have a Smith's and other small restaurants, the only thing is that although convenient to where I live, pretty much all the food places here are about a 2-3 star restaurants including Tutti Bella, they don't have as many flavors as Yogurtland in Town Square and I don't think they had as many toppings either.  I do enjoy the cleanliness and freshness of the fresh fruit though and added a star for their frequent buyers card.  * My yogurt of choice here is cheesecake and chocolate topped with mochi , crushed almond roca, corn flakes and sprinkled with almond powder.....yum!
