The staff is very helpful! My daughter "had" to have a pair of rollerblades but they were asking $50 for a pair that I know she'll grow out of in a few months. The staff member that was helping us was quick to agree to a lower price. I've bought and sold items at this location and have always had a great experience!

This place is not what it seems. The location has limited used items and all the new items are pricey. Would not waste time on a visit, recommend calling before going to get prices and see if they have what you need
