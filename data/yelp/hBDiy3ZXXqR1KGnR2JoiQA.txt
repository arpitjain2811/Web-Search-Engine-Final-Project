Finally.  I had some problems with our roof and had called a lot of places to ask them to come out.  Finally Collum Roofing did come out and they did great work, very professional and quick.  Would highly recommend them.

I would like to truly provide a review but I have been trying to get an appointment for a quote for 3 weeks.  Yes, an appointment to get a quote.  Called them several times and they told me they are busy.  But, they said I could call them back to remind them to call me if I would like.  Are you FLIPPING kidding me!?!?!?!  With that kind of customer service they will not be busy for very long.  Not trying to be mean but there are too many options out there to receive this type of response.

They came to my house and provided an free estimate. After 3 months I got the bill. When I called them and asked why they are sending me the invoice, I was told that they did the work based on my verbal consent. They did not call me before or after finishing the work. The roof still leaks. I did not give any verbal consent to them. The women on the phone was very abusive. I won't suggest them to anybody.
