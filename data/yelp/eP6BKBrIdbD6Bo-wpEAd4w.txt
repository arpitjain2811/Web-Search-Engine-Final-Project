Beautifully staffed with friendly people. Clean & comfortable place to hang. Denise on day shift is the best!

Used to be a regular here but as I've moved away it's far less often that I visit. Originally this was a nice quiet (mostly locals) bar with a few pool tables, some great bartenders, and decent gambling. I drove by quite a few times before stopping in on a recommendation and fell in love with the place after my second visit. Over the years the bar has changed to serve a younger crowd (including karaoke on Friday nights), but most of the bartenders are still great and I stop in when I'm on this side of town for good times. I recommend it to anyone looking for a locals bar on the weeknights, or the younger crowd on the weekends.

Moved to Vegas about a year ago and this bar was right by my house.  From day one the staff was polite, hilarious, aggressive, and knew how to pour a strong a** drink.  I have been in for every shift and there is something I like about about every bartender.  I would recommend this bar to anyone.  There is a kitchen.  The food is great..try the Gyros.....my fave.
