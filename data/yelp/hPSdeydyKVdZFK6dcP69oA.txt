Not too happy. Got a gel manicure and pedicure, charged $3 to take off gel. Just soaked hands in acetone, did not do wonders for my hands, never charged at any other place to take off gel. Manicure and pedicure was fine but literally next day both feet had issues. For sure I got infections on both feet (large toes) from pedicure. Not sure if tools were clean or not but next day I knew I was in trouble. Dealing with this for the last 3 weeks. Very painful. Will not be back.

My wife went in this salon for a set of gel nails. The experience was awful. The technician would not honor her request to make the nails thinner. Then, the technician cut the cuticle, causing it to bleed. She never even apologized. There was polish all over her cuticles when she was supposedly finished. My wife had to point out all the areas where the polish was applied sloppily. I would never recommend this salon. The only reason I gave it one star is that you have to assign a rating.
