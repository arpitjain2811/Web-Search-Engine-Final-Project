This place had escaped my attention until now, so I was very pleasantly surprised when I popped in for lunch, earlier today. Overall: "I was very impressed with Crolla's. The fact that lunch (soup and a filled roll) cost a total of Â£3.70, which struck me as exceptionally good value, only served to add a cherry on the top. I'd suggest you seek it out give it a try. From now on, it'll be on my regular rotation of lunch places."
