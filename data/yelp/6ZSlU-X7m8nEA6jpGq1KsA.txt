We were on a trip and had to do an ad hoc visit.  Dr. Zhu is really friendly and staff is also nice.  The doctor explains everything well and we are really satisfied.  I would say this is the best dental experience we had.  I wish he could be closer to where I live.

Average location, friendly people, they get the job done. I give it 4 because they do what is advertised, and the dentist is a cool guy, but nothing WOW.
