Pizza's ok. Customer service is awful.

The place is clean and updated, which is a plus, but everything else was sort of lacking.  The service was slow, the food was mediocre.

Nice atmosphere, the building was converted from an old car wash. The pizza is decent. Cheeseburger pizza is our favorite, it's really really good.
