I would be lost without my "treatments" from Carrie. I have had the pleasure of going to Carrie for over 5 years.   Her quality of service is alway "top notch".   Above all, Carrie is extremely professional, caring individual who is dedicated to making you be your  BEST!

Carrie is awesome. I mean look at my lips, I am fabulous!  I started coming to her in 2007 and do not trust anyone else but her. She is very sweet, knowledgable and helpful. I never thought I would let anyone touch my face, but with Carrie I feel safe in knowing she truly is an expert. She always tries to find you the best deal via rebates and coupons too. I highly recommend her to anyone considering botox or fillers.
