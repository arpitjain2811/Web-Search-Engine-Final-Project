Believe it or not, their coffee is tremendous! And it's organic. Better than most actual coffee shops!! Taste it. You'll love it. They know what they're doing!

Visited Cream City Caf√© tonight for the first time with the family. Great reviews from everybody. Kids had ice cream and the wife and I had gelato. Love the fact that they have both. The only reason we held back the last star was they are just doing their  soft open and we are waiting to see what they have when they're in full operation. Fully anticipate that this will be a five star stop for us. The owner and staff were very friendly and helpful. They have a great terrace in the back which will be really pleasant stop when the weather cools down a bit. Great addition to MMR.

Being from WI the dairyland, their product is legit!! I had a scoop of the Vanilla ice cream and the Salted Caramel gelato...heaven!! So creamy and flavorful, reminded me of summers in WI!! Price is absolutely correct for such a premium product!!!

I love this place! I'm going to bring all my friends here in the future! The ice cream is great just as good as the art on the walls and the service given. I'm excited to return!
