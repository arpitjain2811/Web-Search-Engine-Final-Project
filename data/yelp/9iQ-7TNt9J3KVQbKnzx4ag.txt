Love natural looking extensions and Heather did a fabulous job on my eyes; not too long, not too much or too little.   Just perfect plus she is a delightful young lady.

Amazing!  MJ saved me today.  Had a horrible experience somewhere else and MJ got me in the next day to give me the experience and end results I was looking for.  Her staff was awesome and put me completly at ease.  I would recommend her to anyone!  Thanks again!
