Good exercise, great place to meet people and loud music to keep you energized!! We play every Tuesday and Wednesday from 7-9 pm Tuesday is our league nights, its easy to join (no experience required) and Wednesday is our open gym night, $7 per person. Come and hop on the court, there are no designated teams. Thursdays we play at Inspire courts in Gilbert from 8-10 pm, check our website for more info.

Awesome group of people, found a year and half ago and haven't missed a week since!  The sport is easy and for any ability, the music and costumes are a bonus, but the friendships made are priceless! Love, love,  love this place/people/sport!!
