My poor beloved laptop died so I brought it to Mac Service Experts. Turns out I needed a new logic board, a pricey repair. Per my google search, their estimate was much lower than if I had taken it directly to Apple. I was also surprised with a new bottom cover, batter and 2 extra GB of memory for no extra charge. Great experience and my laptop is running like new!
