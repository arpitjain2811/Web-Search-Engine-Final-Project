Looked at multiple choices of high quality flooring, ended up choosing a new Shaw product that Toliver's was carrying.  Sales person was highly knowledgable with the product.  My floor was measured correctly, and product was ordered promptly.  Toliver's called me with a installment date and time.  The installers that Toliver's employed were on time and very professional, they even helped me move a VERY heavy armoire out of the way, and then back in place after the job was complete.  After the job was complete, my husband and I sat back in our  "New" living room and were beyond pleased!  I cant wait to redo our 2nd level! We will definitely be using this local family operated company again!
