l called Bruce to have him fix the trim that was damaged during the new a/c unit install. And he was able to come out in two days and repaired and painted it. We were very happy with his work. Thank you.

I never hesitate giving out Bruce's name & info to others when people are in need of a handyman.  The job is always done right. I do follow up with my referrals & his new customer are always thankful they found A-1 Hand Handyman.
