Tasty grub. Fast food wasn't exactly "fast," but I'll wait for fresh food.  Friendly employee at drive thru.

keep this place clean! whwn I was sitting by the cash register I could see how dirty it was. Brown paper towels,papers,trash can full  and walking buy like there was nothing on the floor.it was a slow night. Nobody was there but my couisn and me. Please keep your work area clean cause it makes jack in the box dirty and ghetto.

Since this is the closest Jack N Box to me, I sure am glad they do a great job! Food is always fresh and made pretty quick compared to other JNB! I really like the Strawberry Smoothies and the way my car is made, the small cup sits below the rim of my cup holder making it impossible to get the cup out with out making a mess, but they always accommodate me and make a small smoothie but put it in the large cup! Glad to have this fast food place close to me!
