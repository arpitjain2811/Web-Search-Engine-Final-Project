For the harder rocker in you, this was the station to listen to. This with Dave Pratt in the morning made it all fun and worth while. Too bad my head banging days gave me a wee case of whiplash, but rock on my friends, rock on!

My favorite part of KUPD is the morning show, The Morning Sickness with John Holmberg.  I love the crews jokes so much I actually get disappointed when they play music.  The downside is laughing so hard you pee your pants on the way to work, so my advice is to stop wearing pants in the car.  Trust me, it will be to your benefit, and it may get you out of a speeding ticket.  (Following statement is not legal advice, nor should it be construed as such, tickets and pants are the sole responsibility of the reader.) The rest of the day is good, lots and lots of good hard rock, without a ton of repeated songs.  You can also listen online, which is great at work when I forget my iPod.

There is nothing that I don't like about KUPD.  My husband finds it annoying that I come home and talk about them after listening for the day.  I'm sad when they go on vacation.  Good show.  Everyone compliments one another.  Chuck (top brass) you have a wonderful show on your hands.  Don't change a thing!!!

Absolutely love the guys and the station. Everyone from the 'corporate' to the promotions team, are awesome and make every event an adventure.  As for the location, it's a lil nestled away in the Guadalupe area. So the building may throw you off. Everyone here is a a lot of fun and sincerely some of the nicest people you will meet!

The morning show is the best.  Holmberg and Brady are so funny.  They have great comedians as guests.  No fake kiss up interviews.   Honest and funny.
