It's such a bright, whimsical place, it's fun just to wander around and "discover" treasures in the store.  I LOVE my MacKenzie Childs purchase and was very pleased with the service...attentive, but not hovering...helpful and friendly.  All in all, a great experience.

My favorite place to shop for gifts & home decor. They always have something unique & of course their collection of Mackenzie-Childs is huge. Such a fan!!

Such a beautiful store! My favorite place to shop for MacKenzie-Childs and gifts for over 20 years. Everyone is always so nice and helpful! A must go if you're in the Phoenix area.
