The muter paneer was a bit runny for me but tasted ok.  As main entree I had the karahi murghi keema massalla, which was good but not awesome.  It's somewhat odd to see only western dessert in the menu, but nevertheless the one I had (something with biscuit and ice cream) was excellent.  Will give a try again in the future.

Close to the Marriott, easy walking distance, but they deliver for anything over 12 pounds (order online!).  Food arrived fast and very hot!  Food was good quality for the price - spicy mushrooms were excellent! http://www.abida-restaurant.co.uk/home
