Small place with a great menu. You can tell all the items on the menu were well thought out. Talked with the owner and he said he makes everything but the mayo from scratch, can't beat that.

Great cafe, conveniently located on Goldwater, off Indian School Rd.  stopped in for a quick to go lunch and ordered the Mediterranean chicken sandwich. It was very flavorful and was really good.    Nice to see another option in the area!

Hidden gem! Aside from Defalco's deli there are very few good deli's in old town. The menu is limited but the sandwiches are very tasty. We had the new york reuben and Italian beef and will definitely be going back.

I have been eyeballing this deli for a few weeks and finally stopped in for lunch. Very nice place. Sandwiches were great. I had a Cuban sandwich that consisted of some pork tenderloin, Black Forrest Ham, cheese pickle and a great mustard. And grilled to boot. $8 for a sandwich and a side of potato salad. Definitely recommended.
