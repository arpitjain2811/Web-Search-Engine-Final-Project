Hungry, lazy, and did not want to cook.  We have a subway in the neighborhood shopping plaza, so what the heck.  Sandwiches it is for dinner.  I have not been to a subways in over 8 months or so.  I got the chicken bacon ranch.  Not too bad.  More chicken would have been nice.

Everyone is always nice and polite every time I come to this location. They are a little slow some times, possibly understaffed but no complaints.  On the occasional lazy morning where I don't feel like cooking or shopping, they make a great breakfast flatbread sandwich; if you haven't tried it, ya should!
