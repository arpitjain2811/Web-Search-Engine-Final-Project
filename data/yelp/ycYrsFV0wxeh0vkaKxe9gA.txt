Ever since I had my pizza thrown at my feet and change thrown to my face from the Manager of this restaurant in 2008, I have since never ordered a pizza from Domino's.  That happen when I commented on how my friend felt uncomfortable of the way she looked at him. Then came flying pizzas and flying money, yeah fantastic experience

We went here because I was craving the stuffed bread with bacon, cheese, and jalapenos.  It has been a few weeks now, but they were super busy, super friendly, seemed short staffed and still got our food within a reasonable amount of time.  Would have been all stars but my bread was a little overdone.
