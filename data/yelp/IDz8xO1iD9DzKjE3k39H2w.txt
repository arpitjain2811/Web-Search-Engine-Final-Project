Quality parts sold here, you can check out the pictures.. Exceptional, friendly customer service. IF you don't see what you want they're more than happy to order what you need. They also have a garage in the back if you need work done.  I've never once had an issue.  They're informative and will help you if you're not sure about a part/mod/upgrade.  They're specialties are Hondas, and Acuras.  They usually post to facebook what's in stock or on sale (Black Friday events). They have a built race car on their facebook page check it out here. https://www.facebook.com/jet.autowerks

Seemed like another cool shop in Vegas. Had what I needed in stock. Didn't feel rushed or anything. Was a nice experience. Will come back for some parts here and there!

What a great group of guys working here. They have this shop to make a small honest living- not to over price strangers and try to up sale everything. This place over stocks everything and if they don't have it, they will probably order it because you want it and over stock on it. I recommend going here for your small parts and accessories.
