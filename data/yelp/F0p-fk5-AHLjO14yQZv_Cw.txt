This walgreens is a new location to the Santan Valley area and is always clean, fully stocked and the employees are always friendly.

Worst pharmacy ever! They are slow as molasses and they tell me every time they are short staffed! If prescriptions are ready for pickup why does it take over 20 minutes every single time to get my single prescription. I'm a very patient person, but this makes me want to go postal! Go somewhere else and save yourself the time!!!
