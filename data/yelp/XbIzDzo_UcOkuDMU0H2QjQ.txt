I have had two children go through this school and both liked it for different reasons.  My nephew [who lived with us] was into sports and loved the school for it's extra-cirricular activities.  My daughter was into the arts and loved the drama, music and art programs.  Both made honor society, and are now doing well in College, which is better than most of their current classmates... so they must have done something right at this school.

Horrible school with a major drug problem.  From the principal to counselors to teachers - no one was helpful or with it.  I know of many other parents who moved thier children after the first year due to lack of care/concern on the part of the school.  One counselor even had a DUI the year we were there and she remained in her position counseling children.
