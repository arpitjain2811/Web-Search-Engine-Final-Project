Talk about rhinestone heaven!!  I LOVED this place from the instant I walked in the door!  The staff were super nice, the items priced beyond perfect and talk about bling!  I get so many compliments on all the jewelry I've purchased that I have orders for friends when I'm back in town in a few weeks!  I can't wait to go back and if you love bling of all kinds, makeup, hair accessories or tricked out clothes, go to Dubarry - you won't be disappointed!

I brought a pair of earrings for my mother for Mother Day. And today I am in Store because they broke. They said that they could not exchange and No refunds. They will try to Fix. After I get My Mother earring I will never shop here again. Very rude
