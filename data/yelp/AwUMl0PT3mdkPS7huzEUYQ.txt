I agree completely with Patrick K. This was a dangerous and pathetically organized waste of my time and money from the moment we eventually arrived. "Park on Cave Creek Rd and wait for event shuttle " said the event literature. We did and then wait for 45 minutes being passed by full shuttle buses packed like cattle...at that point give up and walk aimlessly for a mile on a dangerous stretch of highway. Clueless staff, badly organized ticket lines, more security than I've ever seen at any event...think they were expecting a rough crowd or just a really irate bunch of regular people? Then the real dangerous stuff began, this venue was way too small for balloons, check out the video on y o u tube where the balloon breaks its tether, and a 1000lb basket with burners and propane tanks heads for the crowd then performs an emergency take off with part of the envelope on fire!!! Heard the guy landed safely, he averted disaster.

I'm not certain that I could add anything to what has already been written.  I was really disappointed...no...I was pissed, for all the reasons mentioned here.  Even the music was horrible.  But it makes me curious what the Event Planners has intended this event to be!?? Ironically, my pictures from the event are just beautiful!  Being able to be there, under the balloons, with so many of them right there to experience was cool.  I hope they can build on that in the future. Unfortunately, now they will have to work twice as hard to get me to come back.
