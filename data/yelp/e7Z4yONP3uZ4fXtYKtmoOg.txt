Post offices make me go Postal. Duh. But I swear this post office makes me smile EVERYTIME I go in.  It's the kinda post office where people know you by name (or at least by face) everyone is SUPER helpful, and tell you stories of their last trips to Jamaica where they wore tube socks with sandals. I know there are TONS of choices, and frankly, if you want great and friendly service (with few line debaucles) go to Hilldale.. Besides, the Milwaukee Street one is too#@#!#@$#$ far away...

Why bother having an automated postage kiosk when you're not open beyond normal post office hours? Nearest 24/hr Post Office is 5 miles away, on Struck... Nice. I feel bad for anyone that has a PO box here; good luck checking your mail after hours or on weekends...

The parking lot is small but usually the turnaround is quick enough that you just need to wait a few minutes for someone to leave.  There can be lines around the holidays or towards closing time, but the few times I cut it close and showed up 5-10 minutes before closing they stayed open a few more minutes to make sure I got my package in.  The officers here have always been courteous and helpful, even taking some extra time out of their way to help me figure out the best deal for mailing my package the quickest and cheapest way possible.
