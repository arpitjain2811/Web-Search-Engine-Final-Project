They had the socks I was looking for!!  I'd been all over the desert looking for a specific brand and style of sock.  I'd struck out at Ross and TJ Maxx, but I found what I was looking for here. I'm not sure why, but the best Marshalls I've been to are in the Arizona heat.  Looks like I'll be visiting grandma more often whenever I need clothes...

The store is usually clean and organized, so it's easy get in and get out if your looking for something specific. Return policy is ok. More selection than Ross and is just a smidgen better than TJMaxx. I live close so I'm always popping in checking on any good deals in the home department. Good shopping spot!

dude! 4 shirts and 2 shorts for $80 all designer, need I say more?  Not to mention this place is not super packed because of the area.  Don't really have much else to say here....
