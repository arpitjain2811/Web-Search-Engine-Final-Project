The best Shawarma in Kitchener!  I've had better elsewhere, but if you are looking for Shawarma in Kitchener, this is the place.  There was another Shawarma place here, but frankly I haven not noticed much of a change since the change. Highland Halal Shawarma keeps the menu pretty simple.  Shawarmas are the big draw, but there are also Gyros, Falafels and Fresh Cut Fries.  I am a big fan of the Full Flavour Shawarma, which has pickles, sauce and lots of chicken.  The place is pretty small and it really is only set up for takeout (there are two stools for customers in the whole restaurant, and it can get pretty busy here).
