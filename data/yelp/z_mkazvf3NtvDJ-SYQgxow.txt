Kind of like a one night stand, quick, dirty, cheap and you feel like crap in the morning.

Five dollar pizza. Not great tasting, but better than a mess in the kitchen some nights.

It is what it is.  You don't go in expecting miracles, and they won't give you miracles.  It's cheap.  It's fast.  And it reheats well the next day.  What more do you want?

What can anyone say about a large 5.00 pizza. It has a good taste and is fresh and hot. Dollar for dollar it is a great deal
