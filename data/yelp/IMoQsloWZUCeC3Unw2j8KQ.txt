Besides a beautiful pedicure and manicure, Lush has the best chairs I have ever experienced!  They are brand new and make you feel as if there is a real masseuse working on your back and shoulders!   Lush is clean and airy, with relaxing music playing that feels very spa-like.  The staff is professional and very nice.  The prices are great and there was not a long wait.  You gotta try this place!
