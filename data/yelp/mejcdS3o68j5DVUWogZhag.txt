It's Subway. This one is good, clean, etc. Make sure you say a lot or a little mustard if you get it, otherwise it will be a LOT.

Unfortunately, today was the last day for the $2 6" subs. We bought 4 6" for less than $11 -- not bad. I don't really like subway but this was an exception. I wish they had more choices especially for veggies. There was a new girl there so the line was kind of held up but that's okay. The cashier guy was kind of funny; gave me a chuckle on the way he was responding to his manager.

Loving their new sammich & it's a trip to be able to call ahead & have your sammich ready when you get there. Kudos to you! Excellent & friendly service
