The price out on the sign for gas is the cash price. Its 10c a gallon higher if you use debit or credit. There is also a $5 minimum to use debit or credit in the store. I realize it costs money to utilize credit cards but that's the cost of doing business, Because of this extra fee for choosing not to carry cash, I will go out of my way to avoid this store and spend my money where they want my business.

It's actually the Shell Station now, not sure why they have this. Either way, this is a good place to get inexpensive and quality shell gas.

some how this place is a "shell" station, Its really a bodega/smoke shop that happens to sell gasoline. stay away unless you are out of gas or jonesing for some strawberry e-juice for your killer vape rig.
