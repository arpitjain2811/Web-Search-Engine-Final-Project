This place is amazing!!!!  They were giving free furniture away as part if their grand opening and it was really nice furniture!   They have Way better prices than any of the other stores I've been to and I've been to them all.   The staff is extremely helpful and not pushy at all.   Free cookies and popcorn.   Games for the kids....  So much more!!!   This really is MOR Furniture!!!!!  Everyone was so helpful and.... Shawn Teters is quite possibly the best manager on the face of the earth!

You're not going to find salespeople who are so nice! Darryn thank you so much for all of your help. We won't be going anywhere else to buy our furniture! Went in for my pearls on Mother's Day and wanted to start buying furniture and we DON'T need any!

Found the perfect couch here.  Darryn was our sales guy and was very helpful.  Lots of selections here.  We were pleasantly surprised.
