I was told by a fellow yelper that this place has fresh lamajune, so we decided to check it out, They have lots of good looking pastry and lamajune was on the menu up on the wall but when we ordered it they said they were out waste of a trip, maybe if I'm on that side of town again ill stop in and try again.
