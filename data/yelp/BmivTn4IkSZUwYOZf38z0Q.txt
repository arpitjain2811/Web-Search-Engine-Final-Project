The restaurant was clean and bright. The service was fast & friendly - fantastic. The food was very good and Halal, but a bit greasy. We ordered the lasagna with meat sauce, chicken fingers, and the buffalo chicken pizza. The dough was crisp, the chicken was well cooked. Would've preferred more cheese, so will request extra next time. Son n daughter finished their chicken & lasagna, respectively, and said that they really enjoyed it! Great place for a quick and inexpensive family dinner night.
