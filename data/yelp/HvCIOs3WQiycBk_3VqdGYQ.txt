If you need your 2G iPhone repaired....these guys can take care of you!  They know their stuff and are quick.

Terrible service--they replaced my phone screen and it broke within 2 wks. Phone was not dropped or mishandled, just cracked and "owner" would not honor their warranty. They only accept cash--that should be a red flag if you are considering a business like this!

They've come to my rescue several times... from replacing a trackball (previous Blackberry phone), replacing the glass on my Evo... twice (before I broke down and invested on an Otterbox). They do expert work and they're as fair and honest repairmen I've ever seen. They have two shops: on in AZ Mills (haven't been there) and the other's on the SEC of Dobson & Baseline).
