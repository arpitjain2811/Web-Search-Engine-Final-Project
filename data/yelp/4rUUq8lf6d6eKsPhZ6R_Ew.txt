They had some OK clothes here and a few bargains, but terrible customer service.  Someone totally cut me in line and the cashier didn't do a thing about it.  I walked out without making a purchase.

The Children's Place has everything I have a hard time finding everywhere else - great fitting, nice variety of underwear, PJs, trendy outfits, and toys for a great price. Plus there's always discounts and coupons to bring the price down. Check online, watch expiration dates on store coupons, and check the newspaper for sales.
