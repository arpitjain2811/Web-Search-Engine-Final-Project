Great help getting membership setup. Only $29 a month too. Good equipment and it's open 24/7.

Just joined AF- first time fitness club member & am very happy I did. Friendly & very helpful staff, variety of people working out from newbies to muscle heads. Clean, well functioning equipment. Only downside: just 2 bathrooms which can be a problem at busy times.
