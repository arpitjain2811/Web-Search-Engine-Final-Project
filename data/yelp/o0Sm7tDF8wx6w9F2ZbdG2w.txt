I have loved this place since college. Okay maybe not this exact location. =) The lemonade is always just right not too tart nor sweet. Turkey hot dogs, I can't taste the difference. So are they still good for you when they have been battered and deep fried?  Oh I forgot the best part, I still giggle every time I see the girls making the lemonade.

They have Veggie Dogs! The veggie dog will run you about 40 calories fewer than the regular turkey dog. Happy eating :)

Back in high school I used to work in metrocenter and this place still has the best lemonade I have ever had. I have not eaten the food from here so I have no idea on the quality.
