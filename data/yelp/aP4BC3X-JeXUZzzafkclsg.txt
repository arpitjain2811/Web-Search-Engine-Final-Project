My wife an I rented two scooters for three days and had a blast. This was way cheaper then a taxi. The customer service was excellent and they delivered on time and picked up from our hotel. Will be sure to call on out next trip. Thanks

Great way to see and explore the Las Vegas Strip. Me and 3 friends rented scooters had a great time.

Having a scooter to get around Vegas was a great highlight to my trip. Also, I had Soo much fun cruising the strip and got some amazing video of the casinos and my friends riding along. Thank you JAM Scooters!
