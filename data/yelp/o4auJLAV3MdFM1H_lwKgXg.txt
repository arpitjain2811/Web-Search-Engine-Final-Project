The best service you'll find in town. The location is clean, the Thrifty Ice Cream is amazing, and the staff is always on top of things.

I never knew there was a water store that you could drive up to in the parking lot and someone would come out and get your water jugs, fill them for you, and bring them back to your car! I just paid the guy right outside as he loaded them into my car for me. It was so nice because I didn't want to get my 3 & 4 year old kids out just to fill up 2 jugs...a 2 minute job. It was great. I haven't tried their slushie/ice cream, but I hear it's good.
