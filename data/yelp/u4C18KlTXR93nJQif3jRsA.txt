Thrift Shop Two is a hidden gem. This is where a lot of the non-clothing items donated to the Birthlink Thrift Shop round the corner end up, and the shelves are full or random bric-a-brac, household textiles, electronics, records, CDs, DVDs, games, books, and one of the best collections of VHS I've seen in a charity shop in a long time. The staff are always really friendly and helpful, and it's always got something interesting in there if you fancy a rake around!
