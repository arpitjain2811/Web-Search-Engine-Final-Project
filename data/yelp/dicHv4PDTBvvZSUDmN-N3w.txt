Opened in 2006 by guess who (see above)  This place is perfectly nestled between shops and decent eateries if you have a significant other or friend who wants to get within 6 inches of a Heisman trophy or Coach of the Year trophies (while you go to Urban Outfitters or grab some coffee). Unfortunately the other half of the museum was closed due to flooding, but we were able to see enough for the boyfriend to be excited.   Price? FREEZY!  What's priceless? The place opens early (8:30AM) on the weekdays and is close to Sky Harbor Airport (15-20 minutes) if you want to get one last touristy thing in before leaving Arizona.   They have ticket information as well as hats for sale (different college teams of course)

This is the home of the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl (formerly known as the Insight Bowl) & Fiesta Bowl.  You can find a lot of histories for all the schools that ever played in either of the bowl games.

Not that there is anything that special about the place it certainly is cool to stop in if you're ever in the Old Town area. All the football helmets and Heisman Trophy are cool to look at.
