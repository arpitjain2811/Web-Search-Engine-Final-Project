Is close to home. They tried harder and had 24 hour before Safeway closed down on the diagonal corner. Had a return with expired stale food and was treated terribly! So next time my chicken leftovers were spoiled by the next morning I didn,t even bother. Plus you'll have to dodge the high school kids begging for some "spare change" or cigarettes. Just go to Walmart 2 miles away, it's cheaper and they have security.

This Fry's Market it's really clean, located on the SE corner of 107th Ave & Indian School. What I really, really love about this location, unlike the one closer to my house, is that they added a "Olives & Antipasti" Bar!!!!! We had to try some of the assortment of olives and antipasti, and we were not left down. I mean, it is a super-market, right? They had a great array of olives, and also artichokes, peppers, mushrooms, etc. We are planning on going back this Friday!!!

3.5 Stars This is my weekly grocery stop.  This Fry's location is clean and in the process of a remodel.  The deli carries Boar's Head meats which are my favorite!  Their fried chicken is so good.  The non-food items are generally more expensive than the evil super corporate mega grocery store.  Fry's will also multiply your coupons up to $1.
