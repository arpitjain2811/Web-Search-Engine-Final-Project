Alicia is AMAZING. I came in with major split ends and an awkwardly growing out undercut. She blended everything together PERFECTLY, listened to my wants and needs, and left me looking a hundred times sexier!  I don't go to salons as often as I should, since it's hard for me to come up with the money each month - but she provided EXCELLENT service, an incredible cut, and at an unbeatable price.  The salon itself is fantastic, too - not too cold/hot, nice background music, clean and organized. All the products smell amazing, and I'm put at ease knowing they're not putting nasty things like lye or ammonia or whatever on my hair. I'll definitely be a returning customer. Thanks, Alicia!!!!!!!

Everyone here is so talented! My hair was hideous and in need of some major over haul...They listened to my woes and my desires and in no time I had a stinking awesome hair cut! The products they use smell so yummy and work so well!
