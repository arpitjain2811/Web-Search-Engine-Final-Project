Alan (the owner) really took the time to listen to what we wanted, and then directed us to mattresses which fit our rather difficult taste. I had no hesitation buying from him. He even got it delivered same day.

My husband and I went there on a budget we bought a unbelieveable matters from him for such a great price,when it came to deliver it , it was out of stock for two week.Alan didn't want us to wait that long so he upgraded it us for free and had it delivered that day. I haven't seen a person go above and beyond to make somebody that happy may god bless you and your business. Thanx a million Alan! .                                                                             Kat n Nate DeGrange

I shopped around a ton for the right mattress.  Little worried because I kept seeing high prices.  Went to USA mattresses and he gave me the best deal by far with a wide selection.  Comfortable shopping environment, great service, great people, great family business.
