Family run, hole-in-the-wall. Go there for great cheap Mexican food, however don't be surprised if it takes you extra time to order if you can't speak Spanish.  Overall the food was excellent and prices are great.  Bonus- they make fresh squeezed veg/fruit juices to order.  The neighborhood has much to be desired (expect panhandlers and bums on the corner) but don't let that deter you!
