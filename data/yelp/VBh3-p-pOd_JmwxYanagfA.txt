For $5 pizza there isn't much room for complaining. The employees at this location do often seem to be kinda out of it. However, this is my daughters favorite place to get pizza and I have to say it's not that bad.  It's no upscale affair, but it's a-ok for Friday night family movie night. :)

I wish I could upload video of this place while waiting 8 mins for any pizza to come up I video taped the workers in the back goofing off and playing catch. The guy at the register running to the back to make pizzas didn't even wash his hands!!

I really like me sum little caesar's but this location needs a little undercover boss. Ran by kids so there's not much to the order of things. It's basically putting out fires 24/7 here. Thank goodness the little caesar pizza making idea is almost bulletproof because thats the only thing that will keep this place together. Every time I've come here my order gets messed up. No one ever seams happy when they get up to the counter. Orders are messed up or lost in the mix. All the monkeys in the back are running a million miles an hour trying to quickly put out the fires and occasionally you'll see the monkeys fling a little poo.
