This is a great spot all year around.  They are everywhere now as well.  They recently started a birthday club where you get a "love it" size ice cream valid from your birthday to two weeks away. This Cold Stone also does great fundraisers for schools.  They are busy, but well worth the wait!

I've been a Cold Stone fan for years and while just about everything I've tried is amazing, I have created my 'go-to' favorite.  I get sweet cream ice cream, with raspberries and chocolate shavings.  Sometimes, if I'm really treating myself, I add whip cream to the mix.  Everything is delicious, the staff is always friendly and overall the place has a great atmosphere.  I think I just may need to make a visit tonight!
