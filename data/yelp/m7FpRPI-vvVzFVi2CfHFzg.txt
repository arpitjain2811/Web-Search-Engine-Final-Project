Best PTs in my opinion. They have beer pong tables and pool tables. It's close to UNLV so there usually a big crowd after games or on the weekends. I usually go with a big group and drink through happy hour.  My favorite thing is there selections. They have the pear cider and it's the BOMB. Usually the bartenders and really cool, they get a little busy so you gotta be patient.

Visited the PT's on Tropicana two nights in a row during my recent Vegas misadventures.  Really enjoyed the huge mugs of Stone IPA, the tasty food from chef Sonia Lima -- and most of all the outstanding service from bartender Liz Brainard.  I'll be back!
