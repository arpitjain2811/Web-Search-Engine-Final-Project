Yeah, it's a hospital cafeteria, but my undying love for their bread pudding made me feel obligated to share.  Maybe the best dessert I've ever eaten (and I hate using superlatives), it sits in one of the dessert steam trays directly across the main entrance to the cafeteria. Made from whatever happens to be going stale, my favorite is the brioche version, although the blueberry, banana-nut & zucchini incarnationss are all serviceable. I usually spoon out a corner slice that's browned on top with a ~tbsp of caramel. I add a dollup of plain yogurt to cut the sweetness & sliced almonds for added texture. It's amazing, delicious, and easily the best thing I've eaten since moving to Madison, all for $0.20/lb (usually $1-1.50). The rest of the food in the cafeteria is average to above average, not transcendent.

Low prices and wide selection. Cafeteria style, easy access from Ebling Library.

Wanting a hot meal while visiting I picked out the baked 1/4 chicken,  dressing & corn with a soda. The soda wad almost the hottest item. Honestly the chicken was the coldest of the items and I would guess it to about room temp. I think I will visit an area restaurant for the rest of meals!
