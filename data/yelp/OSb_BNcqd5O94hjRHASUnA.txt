Free vacuums, very affordable prices for a self service car wash and very clean. If you are in a budget this is the place to go and have your car shinning. They offer a monthly and year pass for a flat fee unlimited washes or a single $5 for one time wash. I really like it. The only bad thing about it its the rail in the car wash that's why i did not gave them the full 5 star rating.
