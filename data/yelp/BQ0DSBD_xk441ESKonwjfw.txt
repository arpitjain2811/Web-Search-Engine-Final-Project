Wow first one star. This rating is for the service, not the food.  According to James Blake, Subway tastes the same in Shanghai, New York and London. Although most people dont like their jobs, the ladies that work at this particular location really really hate theirs. The sandwiches are sloppy, little to no eye contact, and not one single smile. I'm not saying I want Mrs Personality making my food, but if I wanted to order through a robot I would have gone to Arbys (some of them now have automated ordering machines, they look like ATM's and you can customize your orders, pay, and just wait for your number to be called)  And something else. The stupid 5 dollar foot long song. Seriously, I HATE IT!

This store is now under new management and the crew has been completely changed out.  Customer service is much better as the new manager is an ex-Marine and runs a really tight ship.

Wost sandwich I have had in a really long time. The women that work at this location don't even greet you or look you in your eyes. The owner is never there.. The sandwich making area was filthy!!! This location is  horrendous and to conclude this write up stay away from this nasty location unless you want a sandwich with no meat, veggies, and attitude to go along with it.
