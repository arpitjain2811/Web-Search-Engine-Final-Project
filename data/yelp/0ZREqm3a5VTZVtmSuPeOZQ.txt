Resonable rates... They do not dryclean at the location, which almost scares me because I fell like I'm asking for my clothes to get lost... Luckily that has never happened. But the clothes always comeback smelling clean and fresh.

I have had a few alterations done here, and they have had my clothing ready for me the next day.  Very efficient, reasonable, and the alterations were perfect.

Very impressed with the service here, I had a cocktail dress with a zipper that was totally destroyed. At first I thought maybe it wasn't fixable but I brought it in and they reassured me they could replace the entire zipper. Sure enough 2 days later I get my dress back with a brand new working zipper! Their prices are reasonable and they do an excellent job.
