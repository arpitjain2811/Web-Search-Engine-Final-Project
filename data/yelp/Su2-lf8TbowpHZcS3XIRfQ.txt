Long unneCessary waits sometimes!  ..... Poor customer service.  Which leads me to believe, unsanitary practices are being performed here possibly. Avoid this place if u want

Food is same as any other Taco bell and comes out fast. Whether I'm dining in or in the drive thru, I've never had a problem with my food coming out quickly. Never gets too packed at this location either which is why I like coming here for lunch.

Came here yesterday for lunch. The food tasted fine, like normal taco bell food, but the place wasn't very clean. It looks run down and the customer service wasn't that great. I'm still giving it 3 stars because the food was made like normal, but I will definitely find a different taco bell to go to next time.

Nice employees, very quick service. Great for a late night meal. Staff are friendly and sometimes tell jokes while you wait
