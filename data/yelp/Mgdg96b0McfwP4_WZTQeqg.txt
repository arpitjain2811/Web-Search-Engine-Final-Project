Worse Dairy Queen EVER. Priced Higher than most DQs and horrible customer service. They NEVER get your order right then argue with you if you try to sort it out. The ice cream and hard shell dip is watered down and way overpriced

Slowest Dairy Queen EVER!!!! Seriously all I ordered was a regular sized orange julius and was in line for 25 mins! And this happens every time! They need to stop letting 16 -year-olds run their store! Now that Baskin-Robbins closed down, sadly this is the only place to get ice cream in this town.

If I could give zero stars I would. The slowest fast food place I've ever been to. It seems like no one knows what they're doing but complaining about orders and that they need a break. I don't know why I came back.

Worst Dairy Queen. They didn't know what butter pecan ice cream was. They also refused to sell a blizzard in a waffle cone like they advertise on TV. Long wait at the drive thru.
