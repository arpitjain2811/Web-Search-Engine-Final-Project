I love my daughter's coaches. Especially when they let me know she isn't doing what she's suppose to do.  My daughter has been doing gymnastics since 2 and this is my favorite spot so far.

This is a great place for kids to get good quality exercise at and learn discipline. Every coach here seems to be on top of their game and they all love the kids.  I have been bringing my daughter here since she was 5 and she loves coming every week. I can't say enough good things about this place and the entire staff. And one night a month they have a thing called parents night out...  Drop the kids off at 6:30 and pick them up at 11:30, if course costs a few dollars but my daughter loves it and it gives me a night to see a movie or enjoy a quiet house....  Once again this is a great school and I highly recommend it....
