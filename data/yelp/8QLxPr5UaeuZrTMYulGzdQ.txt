The food was warm not hot . The service was fast and friendly. The place was very clean. They need to put some woods in their fire and it will be better.

Had a Panda bowl with chow mein and broccoli beef, pretty standard for Panda Express. Only problem I had was with the broccoli not being cooked enough it looked and tasted like they threw it in last minute.    Overall restaurant was clean, fast, with very friendly staff and good portions he could barely put the lid on. : )
