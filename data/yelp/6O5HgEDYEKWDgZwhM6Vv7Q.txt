I had my first root canal yesterday and I have to say that today that tooth feels better than it has in a year! It is still a little sore around where they were working on it, but no big deal at all. And there was absolutely NO PAIN during the procedure!  If you ever need an endodontist, he is a keeper! I loved that he introduced himself as "Mike" The procedure was totally painless and he explained every step of the way. His assistant, Tyson, was delightful too.

There are endodontists...and then there are INCREDIBLE endodontists.  Dr. Grabow definitely falls into the latter. It may seem strange that there are people out there who are passionate about dentistry, but Dr. Grabow is that man. He is extremely personable, answers questions with patience (I can be a handful, trust me) and explains procedures in a reassuring and easy to understand way. I was highly impressed with how friendly his staff was and how quick and easy they made my appointment and even offered to see me the same day I called.  If you are in the market for a root canal...you need to see Dr. Grabow. He takes the pain out of a tooth pain.
