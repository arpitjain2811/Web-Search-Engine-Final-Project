I am a current member but not happy with the club. Average food, below average sports club.

The course is always in good shape and the staff very friendly.....the greens are always well maintained and excellent practice facilities. the only negative I have is the restaurant, which consistently has slow service, mediocre food and not a very good menu. Nevertheless is is a very nice course.

My husband and I got married here 5 years ago. We were so happy with everything. The grounds are beautiful, staff is professional, was everything we could have asked for. Yes it is a long drive but well worth it, there nothing like it in Phoenix
