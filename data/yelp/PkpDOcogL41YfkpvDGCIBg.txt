Came by to check out the Prius and James was extremely patient and helpful.  I, like many of u, going to a car dealership can be quite frightening as most of the time salesperson can be very pushy but not James.  If u are looking for a stress free buying experience, I strongly suggest talking to James.

I always disliked dealing with car salesmen until I met James Johnson  at Toyota!  James is an awesome salesman with a very pleasant personality.  James answered all my questions and was very patient even when he had my new car ready for me to drive away  I changed my mind and wanted a different Prius James just smiled when we had to start from the beginning a second time. If your thinking about buying a new car go see James Johnson at Toyota on Sahara..
