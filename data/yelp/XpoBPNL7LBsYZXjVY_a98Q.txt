I always skip this place and head towards Walgreens or the Stop and Shop. The employees stare at you like you're inconveniencing them just for walking in, cigarette prices are jacked up by a ridiculous margin, and they stock nothing aside from junk food and stale bread.

Attitude with over priced merchandise. Walk down the street to walgreens.

The owner is a total ass, he looks at you like are going to steal something out of that crapy store!

This place is very convenient, if you're staying at the Madison Concourse Hotel, it's just around the corner and down the block.  It's also hilarious, they have a sign advertising tours, and a tourist brochure with a map (points off for spelling, bananas, incorrectly), for a place that is about the size of the Madison Concourse hotel rooms (not the luxury suites, the regular rooms), only it's triangle shaped (maybe that's obvious).  I don't think the employees have bad attitudes, I think it's an affectation, they're being ironic.  Well I didn't spend that much time in there, but I did go back, it's pretty convenient.
