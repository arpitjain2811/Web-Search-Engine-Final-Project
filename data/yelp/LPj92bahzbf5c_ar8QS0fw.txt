The Culinary Workers Local No 226 is one of the biggest and best Unions in town.  The actual building the union is housed in is very crammed and in dire need of a touch up.  However, I've enjoyed the benefits of being a card carrying member and urge anyone with the option to give them a try.

A horrible union who only cares about you if you speak no English and listen to everything they tell you. Horrible

Located on Commerce street, this is where the majority of culinary workers go to sign up for their benefits. Lately with all of the Obamacare hoopla, We visited the Culinary Union this past weekend to re-register for our benefits in order to weed out frauds and people who have been abusing the benefits by having people under their coverage who weren't even family!? Because of the small size of the building and the 55,000+ members in the union, people had to endure at least a three hour process...one hour out in the cold, another hour and a half in the warming tent, and the last 30 minutes to get all the paperwork squared away. The workers were quick, efficient, and courteous. This past Monday and Tuesday, people endured a 6 hour wait, so times may vary depending on how many people plan to show up. Also, check their website as the deadline has been extended and there will also be longer hours.  ALOHA!!!
