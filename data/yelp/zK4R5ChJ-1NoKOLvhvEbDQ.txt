This used to be Hilldale Firestone until it was torn down to make way for the updated Hilldale complex. I love these guys.  My family has been taking cars to them for about 25 years and we've always received excellent service.  They're really good about giving you advanced warning on likely problems (especially on older cars).   A big 'ol bill for a new timing belt isn't so bad when you've had four months warning.  Used car pre-sale checks have always been accurate.  The whole shop is customer service oriented and everyone is very friendly.

I've been using these guys since I moved to Madison in 2002- they have always been friendly, up-front, honest, proactive, and helpful with everything from a routine oil change (only $30 and without all the nagging up-sells) to major repairs. On a recent visit, they even helped me get my bike into my hatchback.

Best there is.  These guys have worked on my fleet and personal cars for 15 years.  They are as honest as they come and do a great job.
