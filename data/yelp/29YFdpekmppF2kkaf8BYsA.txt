Hi, I lived in Phoenix for two years and worked out at Die Hard for about a year. The changes in my body, and my knowledge of fitness, were amazing. It's an old school gym of the highest quality. There aren't frills; don't expect TVs, a juice bar, or coddling. The trainers work hard, and they expect you to work hard. If you slack, you will be mocked, but if you try, they will have your back through anything. I love this place, especially owners and trainers Tim and Heather Sparks. They know more about bodybuilding, powerlifting and fitness than any two people I've ever met, and they'll share that knowledge with you, if you want it. The rates are ridiculously cheap for the expertise offered. Try it out.

I love this gym! I would've never thought I'd be capable of lifting the weights I do now and it's all thanks to my trainer Tim Sparkes.
