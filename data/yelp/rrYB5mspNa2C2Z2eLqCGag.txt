Could not ask for better. Brought in a junker car a friend and co-worker was offering to toss my way for cheap. Jeff spent 20 minutes looking over the car, and 45 minutes explaining everything he found with the car. He found things that the owner didn't even know about, and he explained it in a way that even I understood, and I know next to nothing about cars. What more could you ask for?

Had a water pump go out and needed a repair shop.  Didn't want to tow the car, but we found Gerirck's nearby.  Jeff looked it over and gave us an estimate in about 10 minutes.  He did the work, got the car back running and charged a fair price.  If you need a good mechanic, give him a call.
