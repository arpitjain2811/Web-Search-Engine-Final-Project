I had never seen Lynz before but she definitely made a positive impression on me! She modified her schedule and was able to come in early to get three of us in for wedding styling. Two of us had up-do's and there was also a style for the mother of the groom who had shorter hair and we were out of there and looking beautiful in just over an hour. Unbelievable !! Because she also does nails, Lynz was able to help me out by patching up a horrible manicure I had gotten the afternoon prior that was already chipped . (In the future I'll just go straight to her for nails.)  I highly recommend Bella Donna Salon !

Horrible place and unfair pricing for the cheap products she uses. I went to her for an eyelash extension, the owner of the salon claims that she is professionally trained and turns out that she uses fake lashes she purchased at local drug stores (5 dollars a pack) and cheap super glue to glue them on instead of using good products such as Xtreme lashes or Novashes. After going to her, I actually went to a nova lash (leading eyelash brand) specialist and she confirmed that the person who did my eyelash extensions ( the owner of the salon) did not receive any training and her work damaged my lashes as well. The owner also charged me $75 dollars, it was a waste of money and I hope she has some heart to close down her business before she permanently ruins someones beauty.

Lynz was outstanding and did a phenomenal job cutting my hair and providing the best shampoo job EVER . I left feeling great.
