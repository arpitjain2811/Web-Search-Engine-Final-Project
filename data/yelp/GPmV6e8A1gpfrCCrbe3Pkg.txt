Panda is really good.  If your looking for a decent take out chinese dinner, that's about $7 for 3 entrees, this is the place to go.  It's a bit greasy, but tastes just fine!  The only thing I really don't like is the fact that the Kung Pao Chicken tastes like pork (eww).   The resturaunt is always super clean, and so are the restrooms.   Great for eat in, or take out.  The people are always nice, but you can tell when they're having a bad day.  I love to go here to hang out with my friends and have a good time.  I'm surprised they haven't thrown us out yet! :P

As with many chains, this Panda Express location doesn't have a lot to add to.  However, the food was tasty (mmm... MSG), the service was solid, and the interior was clean.

I love panda express especially this one the girls are always nice and polite. The only complaint I would have is they always run out of teriyaki chicken :/ Still love this place tho! The food has always been good and the seating and tables have always been clean. Would definitely recommend this location if you are in the area.
