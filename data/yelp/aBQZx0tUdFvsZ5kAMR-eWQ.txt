Bought 2 tacos,1 soft 1 hard. It was Ok, The price is right thats for sure. $1.06 for two tacos. its kinda like taco bell but the meat seems a little more suspicious.i wouldn't come back here unless i was broke and hungry or very intoxicated. taco bell is a better choice

Nothing too elaborate or profound to speak of here.  Above average "fast food" restaurant when you want Mexican food.  Prices are great with many options.

I enjoy Del Tacos Turkey Tacos with extra cheese. They are low in fat and calories. The service is always very fast. I like Mexican food and most sit down Mexican restaurants can't beet Del Taco. Try a turkey taco today and I think that you will agree with me.
