It's admirable to see a record shop avoid the mainstream. Underground  Solu'shn prides itself on offering those hidden rarities, hard to find gems and an impressive selection of vinyl.  Ultimately this comes at a price with the average vinyl/ CD costing 12-14 pounds.  Nonetheless, unlike the larger entertainment mega-stores, you can try out your chosen record on any of the available decks: a sort of 'try before you buy' system. If your a budding DJ and your looking to boost your track collection with some rare gems, chances are Solu'shn will stock such items.

Underground solution is the sort of independent shop that has survived because it is specialised. HMV or the digital music scene is going to have a hard time controlling the rare vinyl market. Underground Solution is a specialist music store selling, yup, vinyls, as well as a big stock of CDs and some audio equipment. It is genre specific, focusing on dance and electronic music (including drum n bass, House, Techno etc.). As a result this store is visited by DJs and those who really know what they're talking about. Having said that, not being one of the above, I still enjoy browsing their vinyls, and more so, their CDs and I've still come away with a few good finds. Expect to pay for this shops expertise however, as prices are not cheap and the average vinyl is going to cost you Â£10 plus. Note, Underground Solution Records is due to have a new online store soon.
