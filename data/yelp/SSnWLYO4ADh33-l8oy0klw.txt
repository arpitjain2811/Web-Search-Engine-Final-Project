Brookstone is a nerd's idea of paradise. Lots of techy gadgets to check out. Some are fun. Some are functional. Always something to bring a smile to my face. However, on this visit, I was after something specific - I had spotted 4 screen protectors for my iPhone 4 for only $10. A real bargain, especially as Brookstone isn't necessarily the cheapest store to browse in. Also, oddly, this product was only available in the airport Brookstone stores and not in their other retail outlets. An extra bargain was that they fitted the screen protector to my phone for free. My CTG was most pleased

Lady working there was rude and lacked knowledge of her products.
