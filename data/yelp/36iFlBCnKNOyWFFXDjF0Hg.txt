Standard Taco Bell. I used to work by this one a lot. It's always clean and the employees are always nice. I really probably eat far too much of this stuff, but it's so good.

The employees here are all very nice and the food as a whole is what I would expect from a Taco Bell.  But the burrito I had here about two months ago had such a strong patchouli taste that I have not gone back. It seriously tasted as if it had been seasoned with patchouli.

The good is always hot and fresh! It's convenient for me to walk across the parking lot on my lunch break to grab something to eat. The customer service is excellent as well!
