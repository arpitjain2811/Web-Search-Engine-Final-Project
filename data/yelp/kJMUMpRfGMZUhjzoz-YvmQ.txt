We've been to this subway a few times since it was across the street from my work office, so mainly because of convenience is why Ive been here a few times. The subs are normal subway sandwiches, however, I don't know if this is the norm here, but what is usually will pay about 6-7 dollar, they charged 9 bucks for the same sub i always get (double chicken breast on wheat). If I had a choice and if there were more food places nearby, I would most likely choose other place. However, I do know Subway has much more healthier food options.

Pretty same subs as every other location except they charge $2-3 more for the same thing. The staff was pretty stingy with the vegetables too. Save your money and drive 5 minutes to the mineral point location.

Agreed with other reviews... they try to nickel and dime you. I'm not sure if staff are told by management to be "skimpy" on the veggies, but they don't put a lot on. Then when you ask for more, I feel like it is a burden for them. Plus I feel like their selection of $5 subs are less then other locations (could be wrong because I haven't eaten at a subway in a long time). All in all, customer service is lacking to save a little money.
