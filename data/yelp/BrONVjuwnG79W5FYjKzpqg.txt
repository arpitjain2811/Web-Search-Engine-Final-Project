I went to Jodie at Corve to fix my previous hair cut.  She did an AMAZING job with my fine, naturally curly hair and she gave me a cut that really brings out my curls and makes my hair easy to manage.  She really listened to what I wanted and then made suggestions as to how to fix it and it turned out great.  I LOVE my new cut!

I visited Corve for the first time last week, I like the small setting of the one on one space and Jodie did a fantastic job!  She takes the time to ask and really listens to what you want done to your hair.   My hair looks great and I've gotten a ton of compliments!  I highly recommend Jodie!

There were two things that I feel merit the 5 star rating.  One is Jodie's knowledge as a stylist.  She's a walking encyclopedia when it comes to hair, which is a must for me.  I don't let amateurs touch my hair.  The other reason for the 5 stars is her studio.  Very Clean.  Nice shabby-chic motif.  I like that she runs fashion shows during the cut.

Jodi is the best. I can't imagine going anywhere else now that I've found her! She is incredibly thorough with her cut and color and ensures that she understands exactly what you want. I've never been so happy walking out of a studio before. She is super sweet and personable too...an all around great experience! Love the online booking!
