Needed an electrician and my neighbor recommended Econolight.  My neighbor has very high standards so I had confidence in the recommendation.  She did not let me down.  Econolight showed when they said they would.  Gave me an estimate and then did the work.  They were very professional and honest and did the work for the price quoted.  Next time I needed an electrician, I called Econonlight.  Same experience.  They were very courteous, prompt, and performed the work for the price quoted.  These guys are awesome!  I would highly recommend them.
