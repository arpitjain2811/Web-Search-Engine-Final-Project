I am ridiculously picky about who touches my hair. After a few bad haircuts around Tempe, I finally found this place! I don't like that 45 minute Barber experience so these guys are great. They're quick, no BS and straight to the point! Show them a picture of what you want your head to look like and BOOM, that's what it will be. I would highly recommend Feras for a tight fade or a super short style, but Saad if you want a scissor cut. They are true hair sculptors in this joint, but you will pay more than average, well worth it though!

This place is tucked away in the corner of a shopping center that features Food City as it's anchor tenant. I was surprised to learn that it is an Iraqi owned business, but these guys can cut hair pretty good. Don't know if my barber was the owner, but he was friendly and the haircut was only $16. There was no hot towels or razor stuff going on here either. I was out the door in 20 minutes or so and very happy with my new haircut. Oh yea, there is a foosball table in there, but when would I get a chance to play...after my haircut? or against one of the barbers? or is it for them?

JMoose is the best barbershop in the Scottsdale/Tempe area. My son has been going there for years. They are friendly, fast and the cut is always perfect. You can even hang out and watch sports or play foosball.
