Jack in the box is one of my favorites for fast food. The food here tastes good and is made fresh. For breakfast I like to get the Hearty Bowl it has all the breakfast foods mixed in including hash browns and it's pretty filling. You can't go wrong with the 2 tacos for 99 cents either, put some taco sauce on that and its good.

I have a weakness for Breakfast Jacks. I don't know why. This one is notorious for either giving you an incomplete order, or not being able to understand the workers, as I speak English. I mean that in the nicest way possible. (But check your order before you leave.)

It took forever for my food to be made, yet it was cold when it came out.  Jack in the box used to be so good, crappy service now and shitty food
