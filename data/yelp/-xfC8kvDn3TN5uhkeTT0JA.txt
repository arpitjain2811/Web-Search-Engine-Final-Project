This place is a rip off. I will never go back. They quoted me a price and I paid it. Now they are demanding more money.

Buddy the therapy dog is awesome!  Tony was immediate on finding the problem with my daughter's ankle injury from volleyball and basketball.   They recommended stretching and strengthening her hamstring and quad muscles...gave us bands and exercises to go home with and NO physical therapy necessary.   We were referred from Spiral Volleyball, and would highly recommend them.  Easy to make an appt., friendly and knowledgeable staff.    Was a quick in and out, and didn't have to wait forever.
