This is a new Circle K so it is large, clean and has many snacking options.

I tried the french vanilla cappuccino. I was amazed that it is better than starbucks! I paid a dollar 50 for what would cost me 3 dollars at starbucks. I found a new morning coffee joint.

It's a busy location but this place has plenty to choose from

Area could use a little clean up and establishment may want to hire an extra set of hands as the lines have been long recently but not nearly as bad as the one at Gilbert and Queen Creek.

This is my neighborhood store,  so I stop here for convenience.  Staff is most times friendly. This is a smaller and older location.  Store is cleaner than some other Circle K's, but not as maintained as QT stores. Don't look up lights are filthy!!
