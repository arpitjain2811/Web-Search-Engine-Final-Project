Nothing beats $1.75 dry cleaning! You must pay in advance.

Never had any problems with clothes shrinking and it rivals the quality of more expensive counterparts. We even bring our laundry from California when we visit. No one can touch the price of $1.75 per piece for dry cleaning or laundry. Only other thing I noticed is the occassional gasoline smell on dry cleaned clothing.

I come here all the time. I think the prices are fair, and the people there seem alright. I don't really have too high expectations for a dry cleaner, really. All I want is to pick up my clothing in a timely manner and have everything cleaned and pressed, that's it. In all the years I've been coming here, they've ruined two (out of hundreds) of things. They ruined a down mattress topper that they repaid me for, and a light blue Gap dress shirt. I always forget to take the shirt to the dry cleaner to complain, so that is a problem without resolution.  Other than those two incidents, I'm happy. My parents take their stuff there, too, and they don't have qualms, either.
