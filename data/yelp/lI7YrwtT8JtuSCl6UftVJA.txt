This is perfect for a stroll on a sunny afternoon or an alternative (slightly longer but much prettier) cycle or walk into town.  You can venture along it for as long as you like with paths diverting off along the way to the Shore, Leith Walk, Stockbridge, the city centre all the way down to Balerno.  The Water of Leith is a haven in the city. There's nothing more relaxing than a stroll down the walkway or a jog up to the Shore. The Water of Leith walk scores massive points for being so accessible, so good for bike paths and so darn lovely.
