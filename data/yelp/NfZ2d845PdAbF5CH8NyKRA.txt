This company made my little boy's birthday a great celebration!  Even though they are on the west side, and I'm at the Tempe/Phoenix border, they had the best price with a $20 delivery fee.  Plus, they brought the Toy Story combo bounce house a day early, and left it a day late, so we had a whole weekend to bounce!  A very helpful, friendly young man set it up for us.  This is a great small, local business.  I'll come back every time.
