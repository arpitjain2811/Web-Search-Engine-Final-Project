This place has really good "World Famous" shakes.   Try the date one -especially unique. Only problem is they are way overpriced. Good price for gas considering its in the middle of the desert.

The place has adequate space and exceptionally clean bathrooms.  However, the gas prices are outrageous.  But this is expected on the 8.

Great date shake. They have nice amenities, some dates for sale, and friendly people. They also have lots of parking under the trees to grab a nap, a nice kennel for your dog, and is a great place to stop in the desert.

Not amazing but a good stop to pee and grab a drink. It is so very windy here! Watch out for sand in your eyes!
