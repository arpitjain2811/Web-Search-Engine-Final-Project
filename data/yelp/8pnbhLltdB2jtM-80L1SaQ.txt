The Amazing Jonathan show was great, but the Harmon Theatre should be renamed the "Harlem" Theatre.  The building, both inside and out are pretty ghetto.  They try to make it appear upscale, but it doesn't work.  Overall, the place is just rundown and dirty.  :-( As far as I'm concerned, the only thing keeping that place together is tape / glue, and the only thing keeping it open is the Amazing Jonathan Show!

We went to see Hypnotiq the show. Let me say it was too funny! The place is small but a great set up we were at a table up front. We had VIP open bar it was very cheap and best way to start off our Friday night in Vegas
