With the recent death of my grandmother, and father! It really made me starting to think about having a will. So I went ahead and had one wrote up, I just needed to get it notorized, and I was surprised that the UPS Store takes care of that!! I had a couple of witnesses with me to sign, they knew exactly what I had to do. The only reason why I did not give them 5-star review. I was there the day before, no more then a couple of minutes past closing time. I run a branch for my company, one thing I learned is never turn away customers!

Dropped off a prepaid package return to Amazon. Needed the box taped shut. $1 to tape it shut, allowed as a donation to the charity cup. Kind of disappointed that a service that used to be free is now so blatantly overpriced. Polite staff though. Just make sure your items are fully packaged before going.

I recently had an antique desk I wanted to send to my nephew.  I contacted this UPS store and was told they could pack and ship this for us.  Everything went smoothly, and the desk was received in Ohio in perfect shape.  Great job for handling our family heirloom as carefully as we would.  Thank  you.
