Went after the show.   Small limited supply. Never saw anyone there. Can find any of the items online Clothes pricy...  All the items were average quality Would not recommend  Love Britney this is not doing justice!

I LOVEEEEE Britney so this was by far my dream store!! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is I felt it could have had more! There was lots of stuff but you can never have enough Britney! The staff was very friendly in helping my friend and I choose what to get - and yes, the prices were high, but hey - its Britney bitch! Loved it! Definitely hope there are new things when I go back next year. Also one more thing... I hope they soon start an online boutique!! Its awfully expensive to go from Cleveland to Las Vegas just to get a shirt! But I would do it again... ;)

I LOOOOOOOOOOVE BRITNEY!!! BITCH! :) Been to every show. . . this store is has limited merchandise. . . ended up buying a lanyard ($10) and a magnet ($10)  Just like yelper Brandon C.  stated the merchandise sold has "work bitch" written on it.  What happened to the regular concert tees you would purchase after her shows?! Britney, I'm glad I can help support you in a tiny way but pls the designers need to be fired for what they are selling now!
