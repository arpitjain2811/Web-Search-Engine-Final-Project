Great place for a hair cut. Polite, comfortable, nice atmosphere. Got a great hair cut for a reasonable price. Will be getting my hair cut there from now on.

I have had a hard time finding someone good to cut my hair. I have tried many high end salons to no avail.  So, I went to Fantastic Sams, and had Lisa do my hair. LOVE IT,  over the top happy. She actually listens to what you want!  And you can't beat the price, $14.00!  I will go back to Lisa again!
