Great little barber shop, I've been to the flashy flat screen on every chair type of place but found I keep coming back to Beasley's. The  classic barber shop chairs and straight razor shaves remind you of what a barber shop should be.

Just got back from Beasley's Barber Shop.  What a cool, old-school Barber Shop.  When I got there there wasn't a wait.  Jumped in the chair and got a great haircut quickly.  Friendly chat from the three barbers.  Felt like it could have been a modern episode of Andy Griffith.  Beasley's doesn't take appointments, so if there is a wait you draw a playing card from a shoe.  High card goes 1st.   LOL

I'm from out of town (SLC, UT) and went to Beasley's over the Thanksgiving Holiday, so I'd be ready for family pictures. I opted for a full shave of the head and asked my barber to trim the neckline and cheekline of my beard. He used an old school straight razor and did an AMAZING job! On top of that, I got stories of his childhood from when his father was a barber to legitimate cowboys! It was my first straight razor shave, but now that I'm back in Utah, I'm looking for a barber who does them near me! I would highly recommend this shop to anyone wanting a more "old school" experience.

I don't go to the barber often.Infact I havent been to a barber since I was 7, but I came here today with my brothers and these guys are Awesome, very friendly environment. Laid back and chilled out. Has a cowboy feel to it. They also do straight razor shaves. My brother got one and it looked great. It was a pretty far drive,but I don't care,this place is worth it. Will definitely come back.

Came out here from LA for a sporting event and checked around for last minute cut. These guys are old school,, artisans of the hair. Clippers, straight edge, scissors. Not cut by the numbers. Good, fast and cheap, yup you can have all three.
