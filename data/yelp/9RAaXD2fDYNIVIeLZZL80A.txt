Sixteen years with Keith and still going strong. Always accomodating...right up to the last minute.  Consistent, excellent results in a relaxed setting. Brilliant work with color and keratin treatments. Can't imagine going anywhere else.

Lucky for me......I found Keith. He is incredibly talented.  Love my cut & he is incredible with highlights!

I have been a client of Keith's for over 16 years. Keith does color, highlights, cut and style to keep my hair looking it's best.  When I leave the salon, I feel so good about how my hair looks and especially love the compliments I receive. What is nice about the salon is, it's just the client and Keith. So many salons have too many people working on your hair; a person to bring you a drink; a person to wash; a person to color; a person to cut and lastly a person to style. Keith does it all!
