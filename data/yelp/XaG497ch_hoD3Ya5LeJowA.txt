The best experience I had with my two children. It is a fun and exiting way to help your child learn about music and spend time together. It's a great program full of beautiful music and lots of fun. The best part of it is Mis. Brenlie she is WONDERFUL with the children and makes it so much fun.

Kindermusik with Brenlie is the absolute best! I have two sons and have been going to her classes for 3 years and they adore her :)  It's a great way to introduce your little one to music and also connect with other parents.
