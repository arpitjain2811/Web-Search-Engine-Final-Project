the produce section gave my stomach a Charley Horse .  I almost passed out walking by the big stack of bagged potatoes that were giving off a strong stink that was worst than 100 cat liter boxes .  I also saw peppers that were shrived rotten and with unknown white stuff coming out of them .  Once in a while you can find a true bargain that you may or may not need like a #10 can of cocktail sauce that is still in date or warm designer dog coats for our chilly summers .  good LUCK! and happy hunting .

always great stuff. I've been to better ones. But this one is pretty neat, good selection and excellent parking!
