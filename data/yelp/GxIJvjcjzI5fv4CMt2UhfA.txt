This is MY Fry's!  I love this store.  Nice. Neat. Clean.  They have a vast variety of stuff and the atmosphere is a little more "upscale" while the prices are right in line with the rest.

This is my neighborhood Fry's and I LOVE IT!! It is very easy to get in and out and the fact that they carry Boar's Head Deli Meat is a huge plus++. Checkout is always a snap and if they don't stock something just let the Customer Service Manager know what you are looking for and they will usually bring it in.
