100 times better than previous ownership. My wife and I both got sandwiches and beer on a Saturday night and were very impressed.

One of my favorite places to dine and to have drinks in town. I'm a beer geek and the tap selection more than meets my needs. The people that work here always bring a smile. The food? Yum yum. Try the steak sandwich. That sandwich has some kind of magic going on. Clam chowder on Friday nights is some of the best in town. These guys own the Free House in Middleton which is also in our top 5 places to dine in town. If you love great beer and food you gotta visit.
