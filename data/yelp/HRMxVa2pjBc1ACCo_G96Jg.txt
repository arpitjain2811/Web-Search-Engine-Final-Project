Did you know almonds are good for you? That's right -- they can alleviate headache, are full of antioxidants, and curb your appetite, too. So, if you needed another reason to indulge your craving for the nuts, now you have it. Almond Brothers primarily features candied nuts, including their signature cinnamon roasted almonds, which my kids loved but I didn't care for.  I did, however, love their fudge. They also have a nice variety of gift baskets and other items on their website.

A friend gave me a bag of these and they are amazing! My favorite is the cinnamon almonds but there are several flavors like Lemon, Cayenne, Cocoa and they are delicious!  You can find these at your local Spouts and Costco but I was pleased to find out that these can be purchased as gifts on their website!
