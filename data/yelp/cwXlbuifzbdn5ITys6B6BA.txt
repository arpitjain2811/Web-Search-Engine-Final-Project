Good location, and very friendly pharmacy staff. They were out of stock so they put in an order at another location for us so we could still pick it up that evening.

The pharmacy is 24 hours and generally always busy. I haven't had the best experiences there, but whenever I go it looks like they're understaffed by at least 1-2 people. The last time I was there, the girl behind the counter told me she "doesn't usually work back here." Oh... comforting. Unfortunately I do have to keep coming back because it's so close to my apartment. Dammit.

I don't feel like there is much to review for Walgreens. I mean they are all the same, aren't they. This one is pretty clean, nicely laid out, cashiers are not slow and/or incompetent - that's all I need from Walgreens

Pretty standard Walgreens locations - nothing to complain about here! The staff was friendly, the store was well organized and things were easy to find. They had a decent amount of seasonal items if you wanted to go and check them out from now until the end of the year you may find some decent decorating deals. Overall: B+ Standard location - definitely makes shopping predictable and easy!
