I highly recommend Dr Reed  and Insights for Life.  I have used several of her services and attended several of her classes. Dr Reed is very professional and connects on all levels.

I initially went to see Dr. Martha for weight loss, but ended up finding a great center that helps you from the inside out. Her office is a great place to get back on track mentally and physically. Not only did I lose 50lbs in 3 months, but I have gone to some great workshops and even a fabulous trip to Maui. Do yourself a favor and book and appointment with her. Check out her website she has a lot to offer and I am sure you will not be sorry.

I have seen Martha several times with my mom and she really changes not only how you think and feel but your wellbeing too.  Such a great energy to be around!

I have been working with Martha Reed and the Insights staff for a couple years now.  I find them to be some of the most patient and genuine people I have found on this planet.  The Doctor really cares about your results, whatever you want them to be. I have been helped with weight loss, aura cleansing, releasing limiting beliefs, and all in all confidence creation in myself and my abilities/gifts.
