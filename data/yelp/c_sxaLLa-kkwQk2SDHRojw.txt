This is hands down the best coffee I've ever had. The baristas are friendly even to anti-social guy like myself.  I once cheated on Seattle Espresso at starbucks, but ended up throwing away my drink and heading over to Seattle anyway.  Try their Iced Moca, but get a double shot of espresso, its worth it! Oh, and their black and white cookies are some of the best I've ever had!  FREE WI FI TOO!

The drinks are excellent and staff is great.  The patio has a nice feel, but the interior is a little compact and boring.

Not here. Just an Italian Bakery
