Lighthouse Surface solutions came out to clean the grout in my home.  They arrived exactly at they scheduled appointment time.  They came in & took great care to be thorough.  I was also very impressed as they laid towels along my wood flooring so as not to scratch or dirty it with the cleaning hose.  They completed the job in a timely manner & their price was very reasonable.  The owners are very friendly, honest people.  I was very pleased in my dealings with Lighthouse surface solutions! I definitely recommend using them for all of your surface cleaning needs.

I have worked on a professional level with this company, and they are over flowing with integrity and the desire to get the job done correctly, not just to make a buck. As they are in my neighborhood I feel they are the logical choice for a local company, but regardless where you are located, this is an honest, capable, business partner that can take care of your flooring needs.
