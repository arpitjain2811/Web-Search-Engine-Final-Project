My husband went here to order out and the employees acted like they didn't know how to handle that. On the menu you can choose two or three rolled chicken tacos, he asked for 5 and the employee had to go check if that was okay...? Wtf..? He ordered me a chicken burrito and himself a breakfast burrito. The first bite I took I found a chicken bone.. Thought that must have just been a fluke but I found 5 more bones in my burrito...5!!! The chicken tasted old and bland, eventually I had to pull the chicken out of my burrito and just eat the beans and rice. My husband said the breakfast burrito was just mediocre, not what we expected from this place. On top of that the wait was about 25 minutes and the prices are not that great.
