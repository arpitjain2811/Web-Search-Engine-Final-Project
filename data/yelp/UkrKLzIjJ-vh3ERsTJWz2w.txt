I've had 2 cars tinted with James and been immensely pleased with the final products. I also work nearby, and for larger jobs, he has always offered me a ride back to my office. I recommend to all my friends; unrivaled friendliness and customer service.

I am happy with the work James did tinting the glass doors in my office.  He was prompt, friendly and respectful.  His work was clean and efficient.  You really can't ask for better than that.   It's only been a few days since the install, but so far so good.  I'd recommend Sunset Window Tinting.

James at Sunset Tint is the best!  I can't say I've used any other service to compare but he has taken tint off and put new on, tinted over existing tint, and redone a previous owners tint for us on 4 different vehicles ranging from a Fiat 500 (tiny) to a full size Chevy Suburban (large).  My wife and I run a car service, Black and White Limo, and he has tinted every one of our vehicles.  We are a small business so we can't spend $1000's on window tint and James has always worked within our budget and always made time for us when we needed to get something done.  He even has free wifi in his shop if you need to hang out while he gets the job done, cannot complain at all, I have and will refer anyone looking for window tint to James!
