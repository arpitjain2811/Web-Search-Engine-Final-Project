Came here looking for a new keyboard and mouse for my PC, preferrably wireless. The employee who helped us recommended the perfect keyboard and mouse! At first, I wasn't too sure this fancy wireless set would be compatible with my old PC, but the employee insisted it would. I got home to see if it would work and voila! It works amazingly! This employee was extremely helpful and super nice! I would definitely recommend this Office Max to a friend. :)

Lots of good highlighters and pens to choose from -- I'm sold.

Decent selection and prices but not enough staff if you need help.

Good and fair prices compare to Staples and OfficeDepot.  Much friendly employees too.
