Fantastic service, and great staff. The owner is a stand-up guy - what else can I say? We go there for snow cones and ice cream, and always stay to chat with the owner.

This place has Thrifty Ice Cream. Pistachio ice cream is the truth!! The water tastes great here and I couldn't ask for more. yay! There is a .35 charge on your card if your total purchase is less than five dollars. FYI

Love this location! The staff is always very courteous, friendly, and they make it a fun experience. They have the normal water and ice stuff, but also have a great selection of ice cream, snow cones, and other goodies. Definitely a place that I recommend!
