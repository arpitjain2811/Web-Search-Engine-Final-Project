Awesome Bank in a Safeway. Great customer service. Jim Simmons is a wonderful Senior Banker, one who took great care of me, and went to great lengths to make sure that corporate US Bank took care of me. The hours are wonderful as they are open everyday, including Sunday!

I'll be honest, I hate going to the bank. Totally hate it. But as far as banks go, this place is top notch. The staff is professional and courteous. The service is always a step above. If you have to bank (and we all do), you might as well bank here.
