Without a doubt the best place to take your vw beetle. Dan, and his team know their bugs. They are professional, and explaiin everything before they do any work. They were able to fix the things that were screwed up by another vw shop that i have reviewed recently.

It's not worth taking your VW anywhere else! This is just one of the best places of business in existence! Love love love everyone there. The expertise and professionalism are hands-down the greatest anywhere. Wish I had found them years ago!!!!!

The VW world is full of characters, misinformation and dishonest mechanics... These guys know their stuff and are happy to help educate you on the process. Randy and Dan are extremely helpful. Awesome shop
