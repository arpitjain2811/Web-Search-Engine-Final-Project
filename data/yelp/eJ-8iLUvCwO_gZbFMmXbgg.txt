The only problem I have with this place is that the sheer number of choices is dazzling. Health nuts simply can't pass this place up. Pure vitamin bombs.

The staff at the uptown location make better, richer smoothies than the ones I've had at the King/Uni location. I don't know why that is but the K/U ones we've had have been chalky or "off"-tasting, while the uptown ones are delicious. The staff are pleasant and friendly too, and you never have to wait long in line.

All the juices I have tried always tasted good. But after they changed there cup sizes, raised the prices and charged for the booster, I thought it wasnt worth the money especially when your main customers are students on a budget.
