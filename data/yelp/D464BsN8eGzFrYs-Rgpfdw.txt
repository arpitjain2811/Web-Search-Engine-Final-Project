Great Food! If anyone write a negative comment, it would be a offence to this new business. It is a grand new opening restaurant and the boss and their chef really try to make the food as authentic as possible. And the Price is just so low that even make me want to pay more in the tip as compensation. If you do not like the food it means that this type of food are not suited for you but not means that this food is bad. Go there and try, I bet you will like it if you like Chinese food.

i tried three times at this restaurant, the short ribs noodle soup is pretty good.  but today, i tried again, the soup base changed, noodle feels not the same as i previous had, and the short ribs..is tough.  hope it could keep up with the quality of the food...it is unique in town..
