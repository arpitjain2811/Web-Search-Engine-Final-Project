First-time eating Lebanese food.  I had the Schwarma it was very good.It came with hummus/pita bread and a salad. The hummus was excellent and the salad was simple and flavorful. My companion had a gyro sandwich he enjoyed . The young waitress was very friendly and very informative regarding the food and culture of cuisine. Will go back soon for another wonderful experience.

As a parent this was not the place to take a kid, no kid menu. As an adult I thought it was a huge establishment that should have had more going for it. Perhaps I will try it out again in a couple months because the food was okay but nothing special.

Every time I make an attempt go eat here they are always closed. I'm not even sure if they are still operating as a regular restaurant or just a banquet hall.  Very disappointing place.
