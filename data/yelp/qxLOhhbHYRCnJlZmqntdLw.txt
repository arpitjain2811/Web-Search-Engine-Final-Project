Giving blood can be a little stressful, but the staff here is pretty cool.  My only complaint is that it takes so long.  I gave double reds for my birthday and it took 2.5 hours from when I walked in the door- and I have big garden hose veins so it wasn't me.  My wife was a little upset because we were going on vacation and it delayed our trip a tad.  But enough about me.  The phlebotemist didn't miss my vein, I got to watch Tremmors on TV and pigged out on cookies and juice.  I highly recommend that you give blood- if not here then somewhere else.

Get in here and donate your blood!  It takes less than an hour, andyou get great snacks too!  The people are very friendly, the place is spotlessly clean, and it doesn't even hurt!

This staff at this United Blood service is first rate. Always quick and effiiant. They are always staffed and ready to go when I arrive for my appointment. I've donated blood at this location 10+ times and have never had to wait. Of course, I can't encourage everyone enough to donate and donate often.
