Stopped by yesterday after sampling the Road Warrior (pretty much a mocha frappuccino with ground up espresso beans) at the Anthem Village location. The drink and service were great and the place was clean and new-looking. It doesn't strike me as a cozy hangout place, but the coffee's good, so I can't complain.

Ordered the iced coffee with sugar free hazelnut. The coffee tasted horrible, I've had better come from a can of Folgers.

Wish it has a drive thru. The drive thru is for the cleaners next door :p I've come to like the newly converted Madhouse Coffee better. Stopped in here morning of 7/7/11 to get a mocha with banana. It was good, ok price, place was completely empty. Looked like one worker in the whole place. I know its been here a while and I keep going "man I gotta stop in there" glad I did. I would return. I like to ~not~ visit starbucks whenever possible! lol
