Why is the poker player complaining?  No matter what you think about the pricing and that is what it is.  His food is excellent and far better than average BTW.  If you are unhappy with the pricing that is fine, but don't knock the food.  Also, Dave is a great guy who bends over backwards to make my meals on the fly since i travel so much.  He always has my food ready on time and will even alter his schedule for me.  I actually get 2 meals out of each meal.  Anyways give him a shot if you want to eat healthy and don't have the time to cook. Bottom line food is incredible and the service is GREAT!!!!!!

This food is amazing!! So healthy and fresh which usually means not a lot of flavor but not here! Dave has put together healthy recipes full of flavor. Be cautious, when something on the menu says "spicy" it's definitely hot, so beware.
