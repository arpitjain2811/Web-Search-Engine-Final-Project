Had suprisingly good pub food here (buffalo chicken wrap). The fries were OK, not great. I thought the place was a lot nicer than I expected it to be and the patio looked really good too (didn't sit there though, it is October in Canada after all...). Didn't expect a lot honestly and was pretty happy in the end. Service and food delivery could definitely be a little faster.  Note: this review was based on 1 visit.

Great service! Amazing food! Great location. Lots of big screen TVs for viewing any kind of sporting event. Servers are friendly and service is fast. Had the three cheese jalape√±o burger - to die for! Great beer and drink selection as well. Roof top patio for the summer is amazing.

The amount of time to receive drinks from the bar while sitting on the patio is very slow. We have been here for two hours and have only been served our 2nd drink. They need better/faster bartenders to remain competitive. We will take our patio business elsewhere this summer.
