The good:  very easy to order online, quick delivery and the parmesan bread bites are awesome. The bad:  Regular pizzas tend to be a bit on the greasy side and the crust can be a bit too mushy for my taste. The ok:  The new Artisan pizzas have a nice crunchy crust (which I like), but they seem kind of skimpy on toppings.   All in all, if you are mainly looking for a convenient way to get dinner to the table Dominos will work for you.  If you are mainly looking for fabulous tasting pizza, Dominos may not be the best choice.

I've eaten there a few times in the last month.  The folks that work there are pleasant enough, but I usually wait for my food in the store...
