I tried this place out after seeing a friend order a sandwich from here. I looked up their menu and found some unique and delicious sounding choices. I had their buffalo chicken sub and it was about average. The toppings and bread tasted fresh and the chicken good. However, I was a little disappointed with the buffalo sauce. It was not as tasty as some I've had and it was drenched throughout the sandwich. The service was fast and friendly. I will probably return and try some other subs they have on the menu but I'll pass on the buffalo chicken.
