Nice little practice with friendly staff.  Their new office is very nice.  The waiting room has a calming effect because of all the tile and plants.  They don't do their own blood work but there but there is a Sonoran Quest lab in the same office complex.

I have been a patient of Dr Pat Dietzgen for many years.  She takes great care of both myself and my 4 children.  I feel that she listens to my concerns and also offers good suggestions.  I have been to Dr Mark Dietzgen for weight loss help.  I found his recommendations to be very successful.  When my friends ask me where to go for good medical care I always say Ahwatukee Primary Care.

This is the first medical practice I ever felt writing about. The waiting room is warm and comfortable, the staff is friendly, and most importantly, the doctors are great. I have been seeing Patricia Dietzgen for about 3 years now. She is a no nonsense gal. Both her and her husband look you in the eye and have a conversation with you. They call you by name, and make a point of familiarize themselves with you. I just had some back issues and Mark Dietzgen did acupuncture on me. Hobbled in, and walked out. It was great. Everything about this practice is nice. You could compare them to old fashion service with the modern technology to be efficient.

It took me less time to draw blood than to draw tears because I did not have an appointment.  Excellent facilities. The interaction with patients is quick and professional. When you need to test your health..
