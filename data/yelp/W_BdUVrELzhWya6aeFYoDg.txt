My girlfriend and I went here the other night for happy hour. We had the $4.00 house Cabernet, which was really good considering it was a house wine. We split the avocado crab and mango salad. The salad was OK. The crab was pretty tasteless, and the mango was not very ripe. I give the food just a B. Although our service there was an A+! Our server had our food and drinks out fast. I eat there frequently and the other night the restaurant didn't seem like it was on it's "A game". For sure I will go back they always have a really good happy our, yummy specials and delicious deserts!

Oh Red White and Brew...what has happened to you?  I have been coming to RWB for a few years now but the last couple of times I have dined here I have noticed their service has really started to slip.  Their menu has changed slightly over the last couple of years and they took the crab cakes off the menu and they were my favorite thing to order.  However, their menu does offer something for everyone and the quality of their food is very good.  However, their service has gotten so slow and inattentive.  I think they have possibly had a turnover in their staff.  I would really hate to see this restaurant close due to their service issues.  They need to take time to have new servers shadow veteran servers before starting alone on the floor.  I would recommend giving RWB a try because you will get a tasty meal.  On most Friday and Saturday nights they also offer great live music in the bar too.

We love this place! The service is great and the food even better. We really like their Meet the Meat Calzone! It's usually busy at dinner time and you could wait up to 40 minutes, but it is worth it!
