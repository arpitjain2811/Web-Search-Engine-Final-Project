A++ better than another nameless take and bake.. delicious crust and a variety of ingredients. Nice staff and though its farther away than another to remain nameless pizza joint its worth the drive.. very impressed!! Love it!!

I found this take n bake gem on New Years Day and was back within a week to get another.  I really enjoyed this pizza and for the price you really can't go wrong.  Both times the pizza was delicious and both times we got %50 off our next purchase. (within 7 days of receipt)  The gentleman working there is very nice and very helpful.  He makes conversation while making your pizza and holds the door for you as you leave with your gigantic pizza.  I highly recommend Pizza Fresh if you want a take n bake pizza that tastes great and doesn't cost a lot.  Great little find hidden in the corner of the Dana Park shopping center.
