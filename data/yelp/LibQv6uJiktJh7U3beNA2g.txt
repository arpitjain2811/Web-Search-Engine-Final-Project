My brother was craving chinese when he was in town, so we thought we'd give this spot in DC Ranch (Market Street) a whirl. It was sad because although the food was quite good, the place was empty! Granted, it was a Monday night, but having other diners always adds to a restaurant experience. Regardless, the food was some of the best chinese I've head. My husband and I shared the hot and sour soup (which is a huge serving, by the way), as well as the lettuce wraps (equivalent to PF Changs or Yard House - good but basic). My brother had the egg rolls and was very pleased. I had chicken and vegetables in a white sauce, and my husband had the same in a lobster sauce. My brother had sweet and sour chicken, and each was very, very good. The leftovers tasted great as well! We will come back the next time we have a craving for chinese.
