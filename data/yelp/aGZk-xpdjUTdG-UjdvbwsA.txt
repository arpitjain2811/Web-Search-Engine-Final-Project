Brit is great. She's totally down to earth and really knows what shes doing. She takes the time to make you feel special and really cares who you are.

I love this little salon!  Its size means it's a quieter, more relaxing hair experience and Britanie gives you her full attention.  All positives in my book.  Prices are very reasonable and posted at her station, so there's no awkward guesswork.  I love the personal attention I get here and I love supporting small businesses.  If you want to feel like a client and not a number, call Britanie at Olympic!!

Short, sassy, with a little bit of an edge...  I have salt & pepper (mostly white) and wear my hair short.  I just had Britanie shorten and sharpen my look and it is fabulous, easy to wear, and has some attitude.  I have received so many compliments on my hair cut at work this week.  It is a great balanced, artful cut definitely worth double the price.  Nancy
