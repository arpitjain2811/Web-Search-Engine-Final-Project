This is like a standard room Ctyd Marriott.  Had to ask for a fridge to be brought in & it was big & luckily already cool unlike others where it comes in warm.  No wireless.  Very short ethernet cable.  Best rate was $59 so it was not expensive.

My first night I felt like I was at the extension of the county drunk tank or an ASU dorm. Nothing but noise, they had a number of long-term customers staying for an umpire training camp and they were working on their calls until 2 am.   The next day I did get moved to another room, an upgrade, of course it doesn't hurt to be Silver Elite.  The rooms are okay, just another hotel.  It is near the Black Canyon Conference Center but they chained off the short cut.  It is a toss-up between this and the Sheraton down the street - not much of a choice.

This is a nicely located Courtyard right off I-17 and close to a mall. Traffic is a bit brutal at times but it's not LA. Pretty standard Courtyard with fridge but no microwaves. They have wifi now contrary to older reviews.
