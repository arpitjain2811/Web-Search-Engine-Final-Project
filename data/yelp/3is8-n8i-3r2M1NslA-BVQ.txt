Greasy chinese food, very oily. Serving size very large. Decent occasionally.

Cheap, plentiful, and great dive-style chinese food......obsessed with the spicy fish.

A lot of my friends make fun of me for going to Panda King. Telling me things like.... The quality just isn't there. That the food isn't fresh. That the food is excessively oily. That is too salty. That i'm fat.  This is all true.  Now, imagine yourself starving + studying. You'd feel pretty down. Now imagine yourself starving + studying + Panda King. What you see here is true happiness. With its cheaper prices and infinite portions the cost to satisfaction ratio is just unparalleled. Sometimes in life we just want to be a Panda. Fat and lazy, but awesome and sophisticated. Once you understand, you too will become a Panda King.

This was my goto place in my frosh year at waterloo. There is a large variety of sides if you get the special combo. The mapo tofu, fried shrimp, pepper beef and shanghai noodles are some of the best things to get. Recently, I felt their portions have gotten smaller. Only go if you need some quick Chinese and cheap food
