Tried this earlier this year when working nearby and must admit very impressed both with quality of food and service. Not many places i go to can rustle up a toastie that quickly , bit similar to subways but very well staffed and very reasonably priced.

Quite nice, although the meal deals are quite specific about what they contain. If I'm not having a Subway at lunch, I'll come here and have a baguette. Service is generally good, and you can usually get one of the three seats at the window.
