The slogan of White Stuff is "lovely clothes for lovely people", what a contrived saying, they may be trying to be cool and quirky but it's just not working. Overpriced, uninspiring nonsense really and it doesn't entice me at all.  Lastly, White Stuff - what a horrible name to call a shop.

Contrived, overpriced, soulless clothes, and a name, which in a desperate attempt to sound edgy, makes a schoolboy-level pun on based on the substance better known as gentlemens' relish. Waste of time.

I think White  Stuff is getting a bit of  a bad name...! Ok, so all the stuff isn't white, but a little white lie doesn't hurt! (...see what I did there?) It's quite good for what it is....come on now, don't lie!! We all need flip flops at some point, and ok some people are more into this lifestyle than others, but it's a pretty cool one nevertheless!!
