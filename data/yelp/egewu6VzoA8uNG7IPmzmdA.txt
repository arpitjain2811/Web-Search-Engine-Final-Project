Let me just start by saying that i DO personally know these fellas who own this pizza joint.  They used to come into my work EVERY friday and they would give us a couple of pizzas and they are ALWAYS BOMB!!!  They have a location on Cave Creek and Sweetwater (just south of greenway) as well... But their location on Indian School is ALWAYS poppin'!  Their sauce has that GREAT sweet taste to it that makes your mouth water when you think about it!

Yikes...5 people ate here & no one was pleased. I hate giving bad reviews, but the pizza and salad were just bad. I like taking a gamble on "dive/hole-in-the-wall" type places, but this one turned up empty. Dive-like enviornomnet (which we are cool with--actually, looks like a converted Mexican restaurant). Just terrible food. Sorry.

This pizza is better than Pappa Johns , Pizza Hut and Domino's combined. I just wanted to try something different and was very pleased. The only Pizza I like better is  DiCarlo's Pizza in Avondale .
