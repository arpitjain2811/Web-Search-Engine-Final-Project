My favorite place to get my haircut.

I love getting my hair cut here! I've been going to Tina for years and not once have I complained yet! The owner, Tina is super friendly and gives you tips and pointers when you can't decide on a cut. Her son, Marco, is also very nice and just as great as his mom.

Good place to get a haircut. Can sometimes be a hit or miss, but overall a good place.
