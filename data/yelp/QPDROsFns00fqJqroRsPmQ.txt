It's a BP station. Guy running the place seems so melancholic. He was daydreaming when I entered to get a key for the washroom... he didn't let me interrupt his daydream, gazing up into the sky through the front window, while pointing to the key hanging beside the door...

Thanks to Matt W's picture, I recognized that I stop at this particular BP quite often.  Pros:  + Super easy to get in-and-out of + Prices are on-par with everyone else + The morning cashier is always friendly and helpful + Nice selection of grab-n-go "food" (mostly packaged stuff) + Bonus: the sign that posts little "thoughts" is usually quite humorous + Easy to access air compressor (fee based, but works well) Cons: - Quite cramped inside - Not a huge amount of choice for food items other than chips/beef jerky/etc
