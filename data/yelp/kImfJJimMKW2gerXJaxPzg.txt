I love this store. The clothes are gorgeous and fun. I've met the owner a few times, and she is always very sweet and helpful in giving advice on what looks best for me without being too pushy. The girls that work there are helpful as well. I have been going there for years and was excited when they opened up a new location even closer to me.

I have shopped at both stores.  The owner and the staff are extremely helpful and very personable.  I love the clothes...fashionable, unique, reasonably priced.  This is one of my favorite stores in Scottsdale.  I drop in occasionally to see what is new.  Always a pleasant and positive experience.

I looove this boutique.  It is my go to place for that fun party outfit.  Mandy and her gals are so fun and helpful (not pushy...really don't like that).
