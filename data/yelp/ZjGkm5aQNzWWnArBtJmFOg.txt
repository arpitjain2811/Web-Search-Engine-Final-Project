I've been shopping at this location, ever since moving to Las Vegas in 1992.  The first manager I recall meeting there was Alonzo, if I got his name right. I purchase almost all of my home-office supplies here (I work out of my home), and have never felt a need to shop elsewhere, when stocking up on things I need. The product selection is good and the staff members go out of their way to assist me with a variety of goods, services and solutions for occasional problems.  Just one of their many fine associates is NICOLE.  But, ALL of the employees reflect superbly on their District Manager, Don Schmidt, and believe me, it is the way I am treated that brings me back, again and again. I'm sure that you would get the same terrific treatment I have come to expect from them, at any of their locations in the Las Vegas Valley.

I have been to this location for copying and printing orders a number of times the last month. I have found their staff to be fast and very good to work with. Melissa Castro is the best!
