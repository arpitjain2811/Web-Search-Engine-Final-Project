This review isn't for the park - it's mainly for Madison Pool.  The pool is located within the park and has it's own parking lot. The pool is only open during the summer, but they have the best, well priced swim lessons. It's $15 a session and each session is 8 days (Mon through Thur) for about 45 minutes. This is the third year we've done swim lessons and my daughter is swimming so well. She was previously in White Star, but is now in Red Star. I would definitely recommend this pool. It's fairly clean and the staff is really friendly. Yes, it does get hot for parents waiting for their children for 45 minutes, but there are shady areas and if you ask the staff they have plastic chairs to accommodate parents that don't want to take a dip in the pool (I'm a bit of a germaphobe). They also have a swim or dive team if your child is interested.
