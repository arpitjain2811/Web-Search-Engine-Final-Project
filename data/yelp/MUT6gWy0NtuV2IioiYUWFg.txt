The democratic party of Arizona consists of a nice group of  people. I visited their office several years ago with some questions and they were quite helpful.

The Dem party in Arizona is truly wonderful. They push issues that need to be pushed and stand behind their arguments, which by the way, always make sense. These people are doing a fine job running our state and should be lauded as genuine people, willing to do the right thing.
