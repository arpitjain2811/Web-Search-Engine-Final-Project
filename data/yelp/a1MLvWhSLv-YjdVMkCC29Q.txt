Support your local small business. This is an independent pharmacy on the Southwest side of town. They will value your business and treat you with care and compassion. Give them a shot and you won't be disappointed. They accept most insurance. Really fast, friendly service. I get all my prescriptions filled there now.

This place is FAST! We used to going to CVS to fill prescriptions, but we would have to wait hours for a refill or they would be out of a certain medication.  We were actually sent here from a pharmacist at CVS because they were out of a medication for over two weeks. We got just what we needed and they filled it while you waited!  Not even a ten minute wait.  Hooray for small businesses.  Customer service is incredible.  They are completely professional.  They are friendly. They've definitely made a loyal customer out of me.
