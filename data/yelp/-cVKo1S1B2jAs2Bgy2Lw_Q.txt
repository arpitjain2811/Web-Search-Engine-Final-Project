Needed to reset my ATM PIN.  i hour wait, had to make an "appointment" to wait another 10 minutes.  BofA is all about process and not about the customer experience.  The whole transaction took 2 minutes but the drag on my time was over an hour, really?

Great customer service. Friendly people. Occasionally busy but they handle customers quickly but efficiently.

Seriously? 1.5 hours to get a wire transfer?  This is ridiculous. Bank elsewhere.

Everytime I come here weather it be early In the morning , midday , or late afternoon they seem to only have 2 tellers working. Line long and takes a really long time... They need to put more tellers up

I have a safety deposit box here and never have a problem with the service at this location.  They have always been very helpful and I like the fact that they have someone at the front to assist you with whatever questions you have, whether it being talking to a personal banker or just answering questions regarding their international exchange fees, etc.
