'Oooh. Aaah. Shiny things.' Galerie Mirages provoked this reaction in me with it's huge display of beautiful jewellery, trinkets and ornaments. I'm a sucker for cute little ornaments and spent a good while ogling their elephants, birds, everything...It's all wonderful, trust me!  If you're on a budget for a gift, they've got a wide variety of prices from cheaper little trinkets to more expensive jewellery pieces. I had to show some serious restraint, leaving with only a regal blue clip-on peacock! (Which looks marvelous clipped to the ornate gold mirror in my room!)  Now go see shiny things!
