This is a bar that looks as if it is not changed since the 70's a sort of old mans pub feel minus the old man. Even though a small bar they made plenty of room for three plasma tv's and each one with something different for every one. The darts, the cricket and the football shame it's not my cuppa l prefer the news.  Jukebox available no dartboard. But there is a puggy and some warm nuts that cost a fortune or pickled onion crisps.  Music is depressing would be advisable to only have one drink here before going elsewhere.
