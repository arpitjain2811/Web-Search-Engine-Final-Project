Very helpful and great customer service! Had a beautiful custom piece made for a gift.  The owner Ben was extremely knowledgeable.  I would definitely recommend these guys for any diamond jewelry you are looking for.

I don't post many reviews, I felt that I should for Brio.  WOW! What a great store with an amazing selection, and matching customer service! The owner, Ben, helped me with a custom necklace for a friend. This guy really knows his stuff about diamonds and jewelry! Anyone looking for a beautiful piece of jewelry should come to Brio. I will definitely be back.
