The food is good - both breakfast and lunch, however every time we have eaten there, it is a little slow.  One time we were there for 30 minutes after we finished eating - waiting for the bill.  Seems to happen quite often.

Food is so-so ( if you end up getting what you ordered!) and the  service is awful. Last visit we were overwhelmed by the scent of a possible sewer back up?! Yuck!

We stopped over the weekend for lunch. Both had a sandwich and some chilli. The food was acceptable. As with other posts service was a little slow. We sat at the bar and noticed how dirty it was behind the bar. Ice machine vent was full of dust and the floor was disgusting with dirt that has been there for a long time. The place needs a good cleaning.

The food was very tasty bar food. Our service was also very good.  The prices were reasonable. We will definitely go back.
