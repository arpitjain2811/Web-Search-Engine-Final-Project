this is a great quick local wine and liquor store. small but has a good selection and friendly staff. can't argue with the convenience of a drive thru. ask about specials they always have something on sale.

This isn't just your average liquor store.  The drive-thru is convenient and I've never had to wait a long time. Mickey knows his products and always makes good suggestions, if needed. In order to truly appreciate Cellars, you MUST go inside. They have an amazing selection. More mini bottles than anywhere else, a wide range of all liquors, and for the beer drinker- this is the secret place you've been searching for. Their IPA selection is extensive! DogFish 120min! This was the only store I could find that carried it. Best of all, their prices are great.  Go! Take a few minutes and drive out of your way, if needed. It's definitely worth it.

Great local liquor store with an AMAZING beer selection. Their growler station, drive through and the fantastic staff makes this place a very unique store!
