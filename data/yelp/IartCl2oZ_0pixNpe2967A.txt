He does fantastic work.  I was in a horrible car accident and broke my front tooth in half. The cap is absolutely perfect.  He's also totally honest.

Dr. Rhodes and his staff are polite, professional and extremely proficient at their craft.  I have been going to Dr. Rhodes for over 18 years now and could not be more pleased.  His work is truly amazing and nationally recognized.
