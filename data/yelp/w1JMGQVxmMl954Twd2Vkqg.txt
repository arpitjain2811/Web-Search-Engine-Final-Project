Fast in, fast out.  I rarely ever have to wait in line long.  They also have a Redbox outside.

Is it just me? Or, does it seem like bringing a gun to this Walgreens is getting more and more appropriate?

Pretty basic Walgreens wtih all of your essentials.  The one thing worth noting is that they do sell alcohol at this location.  I know not all locations do, so that's something to keep in mind.

I come to this Walgreens quite a bit and just recently, transferred my scripts here as well. The service is good and friendly. The store is well stocked with lots of variety. The pharmacy seems to open a few minutes later than posted hours but maybe it was a rare circumstance. Overall, a good, clean Walgreens.
