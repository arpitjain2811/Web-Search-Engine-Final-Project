Super disappointed in the kids shoe selection.  There were very few pairs of athletic shoes in my daughter's size (size 2 kids), and the ones they had did not fit her well at all. They were either too wide, or they would slip off.   We had one employee greet us when we came in, but we were ignored by every other person there.  We left without making a purchase.

As far as a company, Famous Footwear treats me really well.  But this review is specifically for this location.  The selection available at this store is just terrible.  This might as well be an outlet store.  After stopping in several times over the past 10 years, I've never even seen a shoe, sandal or boot I actually wanted to even try on.   I order most of my shoes online through Famous, but the location at Tempe Marketplace usually has a decent selection.  Head and shoulders above the selection here.

This location has gone above and beyond in customer service for me. Employees are phenomenal.  Clean store, ample parking, great sale prices and a huge selection - and whatever you can't get on site you can order online and have shipped to your home address or pick up in store.  Truly superior management - stop by if you're in the neighborhood.
