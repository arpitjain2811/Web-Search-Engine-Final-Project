Owner Marc Richmond and his crews provide an excellent and professional service at a fair price.  I use him over and over and recommend him to all my clients without hesitation.  Contact them for your home painting needs (interior and exterior) and you won't regret it.

After dealing with so many flaky, disorganized contractors on our homes, working with Marc and DHP was a refreshingly pleasant experience.  While 80% of the other painting contractors we contacted failed to even respond to our inquiries, the DHP team was highly organized and professional.  They not only finished our exterior home painting project on time and on budget, but they proactively communicated with us throughout the project so there were no surprises.  I highly recommend Diamond House Painting.
