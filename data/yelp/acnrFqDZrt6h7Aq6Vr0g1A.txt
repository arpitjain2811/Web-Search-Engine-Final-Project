Beware of Realtor Joseph Devera! Joseph Devera is a shady, unreliable, and untrustworthy realtor. If you have a concern of your realtor don't bother calling partner Harvey Blankfeld, clients are NOT there concern. Lastly if you contact CEO Mark Stark he forwards his concerns to managing broker Catherin Bovard.

We purchased a property through Prudential a couple years ago. Prudential has nice, upscale offices and seems to support their associates well. We worked with Christina Cova-Simmons and could not be happier with the way everything worked. She is a class act and I look forward to working with her again.

I worked with Amanda Young to rent a property from one of her clients and I have had nothing but trouble. It makes me feel uneasy that a realtor who can ignore a water heater leakage into a unit below unti the water damage is so severe it is coming through the electrical sockets still sells houses. Between her and her client that I rent from nothing is ever accomplished. I wouldnt work with a company that employs such people. She is very unprofessional and does not follow through on anything!
