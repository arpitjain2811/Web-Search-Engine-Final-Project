I've been to this place 3 times and it's always fun to get new work boots. JR measures your feet and has you walk around outside to make sure they won't hurt after a while. He tells corny jokes but they are funny and he greets you with a candy bar. You will not leave unsatisfied. If you do he does not mind swapping them for something that better suits your needs.

Extremely nice and helpful guy! Got the boots that worked for me, no pressure, just helpful. Loved the candy bar too  =]

Unbelievable experience, I'm from New England and this is the first time I left a store to buy boots where the service was impeccable. Very knowledgable and a great sense of humor . Take care JR, and thank you.
