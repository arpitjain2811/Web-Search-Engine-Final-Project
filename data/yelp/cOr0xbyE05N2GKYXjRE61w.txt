Great cheap cuts! When we make it out to Luke we always try to stop in if Denise is working. My 6yr old son loves getting his hair cut by Denise. She definitely knows how to properly fade!

Its a Base Barber Shop. It like a box of chocolates you never know what kind of hair cut your going to get. Just stick to the ladies on the right side you can't go wrong.

Cheap base barber....quick and easy. Make sure you accurately convey what you want or you might end up with a high and tight. There is also another barber at the health and wellness center if your not feeling the Bx barber, but don't want to go off base
