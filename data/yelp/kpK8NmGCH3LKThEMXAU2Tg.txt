My hi lights were burned off to the nub by another place, had like 2inches of tufts of hair all over the top of my head and didn't trust anyone!  Now it's been like two years later and my hair has looked awesome ever since!  Great personality, great with hair, just great!

Brittany is great! She is a great colorist and wonderful at understanding my hair vision and making recommendations or suggestions.  Her studio is comfortable and she is great to hang out with during the appointment! She is quick to return calls and making appointments! I would recommend her to anyone looking for a fun, professional, and talented hair stylist and colorist!

I love getting my haircut by Brittany! She does great work and I always lets me change the music station when I'm getting a trim! :)

My hair was thin and dull. Brittany with her expertise has brought my hair back to life. My hair has never looked better. If you want someone who is professional, talented and fun I would recomend Brittany. She won't let you down.

Brittany is the BEST! I have been slightly uncomfortable with other stylists in the past but going to Brittany is like being with a friend. I highly recommend seeing her for color, cut or styling. I trust her with it all! She has never disappointed!
