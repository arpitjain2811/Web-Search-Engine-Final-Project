Our staple 'go-to' Chinese delivery place. I can't tell you how many times we've gotten food delivered from here but it's definitely more than I can count on my fingers and potentially not much fewer if I added in my toes! Food is always piping hot and tasty. I've never felt the need to drink a tonne of water or woken up with puffy eyes due to an over abundance of MSG. We've never had a problem with delivery or ordering on the phone. Never physically been to the restaurant so can't tell you much about that side of things, but can only imagine the food would be even better fresh from the kitchen rather than sitting in a plastic container for 20mins! Thumbs up!

I tried this takeaway for the first time last Monday. I had the Kung Po chicken, but won't be having it again. The chicken was breaded, and the sauce was sticky like a sweet and sour sauce, definitely not authentic Chinese that I was hoping for and it costs more than I expected.  :( Head to takeaway shops on Leith Walk instead.
