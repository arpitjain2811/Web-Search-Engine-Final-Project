Been here a couple of times for take out.  They're pretty quick at pumping out pizzas, and Pizza Hut is always tastier than Domino's, I don't care what the "National Taste Tests" say. For $10, it's not too bad a deal for any size pizza with any number of toppings.  All the employees that I've had contact with at this location are friendly, which is always an important factor. I recommend that Pizza Hut makes a punch card of some sort...buy a few pizzas, get one free, sort of thing.  Talk to management, get back to me.

No salad bar, slow service even when its empty (which they always are) and just nit that great. Go elsewhere.
