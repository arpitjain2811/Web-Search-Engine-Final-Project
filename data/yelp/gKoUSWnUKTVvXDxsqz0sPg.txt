I have been here twice. With no complaints. Always get what I ask for. Friendly staff. They offer a wide variety of services, even ear candling. All services are clearly marked as you walk in. They also offer a repeat customer punch card.  Tuesdays are set aside for senior citizen discount day. It is also for $10 haircuts, where normally it's $13.99. Fireman and people in the military service get a discount everyday.

My wife has been going here for a long time and recommend this place. I took my son with me to get a hair cut. Helen was our stylists. She was very friendly. Helen did outstanding job on both me and my son. This place also offers a good variety of other services. The price of both hair cuts was $ 20 and that included my beard trim. I can't beat that. I soon will be coming back here for my haircuts. Pat O
