This J&J is located right next to the Gold's Gym I frequent in my neighborhood and I usually come here specifically for Quest bars when I run out, which seems to be a lot.  I normally get my supps at a different nutrition shop, but J&J is just convenient when I need some item immediately.  Have you ever had a Quest bar?  I rely on them when I need portable protein without a lot of carbs, calories, or fat.  Plus, they come in tasty flavors, my favorites being Coconut Cashew, Cinnamon Roll, and Mixed Berry.  They just released Cookies n Cream today, so I'll be heading over to get a couple of bars.  They are always friendly here and will price match, but I haven't used that service as of yet.  If you're in the market for vitamins, protein, supplements, or Quest bars, give J&J a try.
