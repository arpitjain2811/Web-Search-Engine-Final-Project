I stayed in a 2 bedroom apt. It was spacious especially for the price. However the neighbor is insanely crazy. Kids run around all hours of the night, you hear gunshots from time to time, my car was keyed, kids ran up and down my stairs daily, they had no supervision, they had roaches, and management continuously lie. I'm glad I got me and my family out alive. - Hestiage Estates apartment homes.
