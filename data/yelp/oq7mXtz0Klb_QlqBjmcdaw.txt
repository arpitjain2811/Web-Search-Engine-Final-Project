Food and service were not special. To me this is a very annoying place! We were the only customer there at that time. I think the owner's friends and families sat next to us. They were talking very loud while we were there. It is very bothering us! Violated our enjoyment.However, nobody seems to care. I hope you can find a better comforter place to dine. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
