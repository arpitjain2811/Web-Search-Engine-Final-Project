Clean. I love this chain for their $1 coupons and gas rewards.  Staff is rude at this location. Every time I ask a question they just stare at me like a deer in headlights. So if I'm only going in and out and not needing to ask anything this is my store of choice.  Oh Yeah ..  The cashier had a hickey on her neck for goodness sake!

My favorite store in Surprise. The only problem is the static electricity!! I get shocked every time I go in there!

They're open till midnight which helps for late dinners and late night snacks :)

Okay, I LOVE the natural food section here, but that is about it. There are always lines and never enough people at check outs. Beware if you go between the months of October-May......those who live there know what I mean....

I used to work here so it had to be good;) Honestly, I would say it is the most friendly place I had been to. Cashiers are willing to except all coupons and work with their customers. The prices are great and the gas rewards system is very useful. I just wish it was a Marketplace instead.
