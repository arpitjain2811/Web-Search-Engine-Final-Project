It's a CVS. It treated us right. Got what we needed. Clean overall.

It's great that they text you when your script is ready! Makes life so much easier, and that alone is worth the 5 stars! It's CVS, not much more to write about!

I have never really been a fan of either CVS or Walgreens locations in my area, but this CVS has just turned that all around.  Honestly, I do not know how they got so much better but the first thing I noticed as a customer is that their staff actually knows what is going on and how to run a store.  They are not miserable at their jobs, and they actually have some personality.  I think this proves the case that good people make all the difference.   CVS photo-lab via the Shutterfly web site was good as well.  Prints were done quickly as promised.  Overall, very happy here.
