Very friendly front desk team, the facilities themselves are well maintained and clean. I have a small 5x5 unit which is indoors and it is always kept cool which I like because I didn't want my stuff to be left in 100 degree heat.  Their prices are some of the lowest in town but they do include a mandatory insurance plan which will cost you an extra $9/mo. I wasn't told about this until I signed my agreement.

Friendly staff. Clean facility. Not too happy that rent was raised for no reason other than I had been there for 5 months.
