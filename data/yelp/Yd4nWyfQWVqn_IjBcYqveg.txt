They always have a pepperoni Hot & Ready! Sometimes they are burnt though, so make sure you check out your pizza before you leave!

I was looking for something quick & cheap for lunch today. I saw a sign for Little Caeser's & stopped inside. I got a large hot & ready pepperoni pizza with an order of crazy bread & dipping sauce for only $8. The pizza wasn't bad, I've definitely had worse. The crazy bread was awesome. I'd come here again for lunch if I was in a hurry & didn't want to spend much.

Strange, as a kid for I remember that I did not like the pizza they have. So for the last, say 15 years I avoided them. Well, for what ever reason I decide to get a pizza from them. And I was surprised.  The pizza was good.  I did not have their deep dish as, in general I don't like thick crust, but what I did have was wonderfully good. And I will be eating more here.
