Yes, please take me to a bar where they play music at a 7 year lag and the bartenders have more testosterone than my old high school gym teacher.  Exactly the atmosphere I want to enter on a Friday night.

Meatmarket for the 30-something crowd.  In all the bad ways.

I'll give Madison's an extra star for it's Happy Hour. It's kind of an okay place to hang after work and get some nachos and a pretty decent martini (it is a vodka bar after all). Come here at night, however, and it's a middle aged, middle America nightmare. Be sure you're good and trashed before you come in here, otherwise you will not have fun. I try not to stay in here long, but my instincts tell me this is a cougar pit.

This place would be at home in a mall...any mall, around the world.  Its a tragic use of what could be an incredible space.  But I'm sure you can drink and eat reasonably here...but is that really what you're looking for?
