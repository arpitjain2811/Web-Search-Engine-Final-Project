The 3,000-square-foot, bilevel nightclub, which is operated by the former owners of Sail Inn, features DJs and live music nightly in a lounge setting. There are cozy sofas, a small dance floor, and a martini and food menu. You'll find a lot of college students hanging out here and local music fans kicking back at this chill Mill Avenue hangout.
