I stopped here as I do periodically to get some items on sale.  Smith's had some items in their mailer that were very nicely priced--great loss leaders. While this isn't the newest of stores, it's clean and I am able to get in and out pretty quickly.  Therefore, it's A-OK for me!

This is my regular stop, no matter what time of day. Most of my friends work here, so it's always nice to be able to pop in and see the special deals of the day. It's always clean, and service is top. Come in late at night for the cheap stuff.

Good prices, and they opened a check stand just as we go in line and they do this all the time. Nice clerks and the selections are great. Oh and SALE ON Gatorade

Smiths is pretty equal throughout, with customer service.  One of my favorite supermarkets to shop at. They have a great seasonal section, every season! The layout of the store is pretty similar to every other Smiths!  The customer service is always top notch! The employees seem to be hard working!  I love shopping at this store, & will continue to shop there!
