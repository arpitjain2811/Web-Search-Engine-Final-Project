I would not want to be anywhere else in the world. Great prices, great layouts, great pool, great gym, and great neighbors. If that wasn't enough, the girls that work in the front office are soo good to me, very helpful, diligent, thorough, and they also just happen to be bangin'!!! What I would give for a night with the St. Clair twins. I know there can only be 1 "Babe of the Year" but these two tie for first place for 2012 and beyond. They always have fresh baked cookies and two beautiful smiles to help wash them down. They even got jokes! I have lived in a lot of places, but St. Clair is by far the best and most pleasant. If I am lucky, I might get to die here : ) I highly recommend, happy hunting.

By far, the best apartment complex I've ever lived in.  I loved it there. If I ever decide to settle down and stop bouncing around the country like some kind of crazy gypsy, I'd go back in a heartbeat.  I still consider this place to be home.

The loft like layouts and the amount of light my unit had was why I moved there. Unlike any other place I've seen in Vegas St. Clairs would be the only place in NV I would call home again. The pool and gym were all top notch.

I love my apartment!!! i moved into the upstairs 2 bed 2 bath and they are darling. Lots of windows! pool is great and HUGE, gym could be a little upgraded but nonetheless nice enough. Emily helped me with my apartment, so pleasant and polite. Pretty Happy With maintenance as well my only complaint is every now and again i will see dog poop around that inconsiderate neighbors do not pick up ! but other than that i am satisfied with my place and will highly recommend it!
