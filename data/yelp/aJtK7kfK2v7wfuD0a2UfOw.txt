Disappointing :(  I was dying for frozen yogurt, wish I had checked to see if Red Mango has hit Phoenix.  Had a scoop of chocolate that was ok.  Unfortunately I also ordered the coconut, which tasted like sunscreen, and ruined my palate for the chocolate.  I think this is the first time I have ever thrown a dessert away in my life.

The yogurt here is pretty good depending on the flavor you choose. I just feel that it is really over priced for what you get.

They serve Only 8 brand frozen yogurt here.  For all you concerned about weight loss out there, this is a good thing.  Not only do they have some great and unique flavors, they all taste good even though they're pretty light on the calories.   I've been to this location twice and the place has been clean and the employees are friendly enough.
