Amazing service, talented staff, welcoming environment, and gorgeous products!  There is even a VIP room that allows you to book for private events, ect... It doesn't matter which artist you go to because everyone is extremely knowledgable and talented!  So you're in good hands no matter what!

Few weeks ago I was in Vegas and was in need of a full makeup revival.. I went to three different make up centers and each place could not accommodate me, and when booking an appointment, they all required a $75 minimum.  I went into NARS and they were so nice and classy, they had me sit down and asked me a series of questions on my skin care, and preferences. I left with over $200 worth of product, I am so impressed with each item and give this establishment and it's it's staff the highest rating I can possibly leave, five stars all the way!

Best experience. Made a natural look. The make up feels light. The artists know what they're doing. Would go back anytime and I'll be ordering on line.
