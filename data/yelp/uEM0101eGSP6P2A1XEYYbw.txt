I took my wife to lunch.  We were greeted as soon as we walked thru the door.  We ordered lunch and the they gave us frozen mugs for our drinks.  The food was very good and restaurant was clean.  We will make many return visits.

I returned here this week and ordered a Cheeseburger Combo at the window.  The service and quick and the food was very good.  This is a great place to try instead of In-n-Out Burger.

Food was great but service was poor. Really unfriendly staff, especially the manager

Walked in tonight and several adult customers were barefoot, the manager was rubbing some guys chest under his shirt, she then began preparing food with washing her hands. At this point she turns and asks what we want. Well we laughed and left. We will never return. DISGUSTING
