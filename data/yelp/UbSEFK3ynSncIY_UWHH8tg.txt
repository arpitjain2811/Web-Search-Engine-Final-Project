Multiple shipping services available, friendly employees, fast service, products available. I love not having to stand in line for 15-20 minutes at the Post Office! The UPS Store offers a variety of shipping options and will help you find the cheapest option. I've been in there probably four-five times in the last two years, and every employee has been very friendly and helpful. They also sell cards, supplies, poster tubes, etc.

They have been great from day one. I relocated to Phoenix and They started helping me prior to moving here. They  continued to help me after I moved here. They are very customer friendly!! The employees are pleasant to work with and very helpful.

Well here is a UPS Store that actually is friendly and cares about its customers.  I can't foresee this one being owned by the one on highland avenue because it's clearly two different types of service. This store seems to care about its customers!!

This is the Worst place to get anything Shipped and Please don't believe a word they say. Tuesday Jan 14 I wanted to  Ship a small bicycle to Puerto Rico the young Hispanic kid behind the  Counter says its going to be over $400 dollars to get this shipped And some older Bald White guys says GEEZ that's a big  36lb package  Then he tells me the USPS won't even  Touch it ... Well guess what USPS did ship it and at a tune of $42.00  STAY CLEAR of these LIARS  It's really a shame I send packages all the time I was just trying them cause they are in my neighborhood .... I don't mind paying extra for the service  But 10 times the amount is a little much..

I've been a customer of this location since October 2012 AD. I ship about two packages every 90 days. I have nothing but good things to say about the service I've received at this location. Solid!

This place has been a life saver twice for me in the past six months.  In addition to all the UPS offerings for shipping, wrapping, greeting cards and office-related impulse purchases, they've got Notary Public service for $2.00.  Excellent.
