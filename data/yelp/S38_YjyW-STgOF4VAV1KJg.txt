Ridiculously cute clothes, a good sale, a friendly cashier, and some truly outlet-priced items.  I had to make myself STOP and get out of there before I got too many teeny outfits.  It would've been sooooo easy to go hog-wild here.   And this is what I've become -- hog wild at a kids' clothing store?   (shakes head and mutters)

Nice big store with lots of clothes for babies and tots.  I thought all of the stores in this mall were outlet stores, but the prices did not strike me as particularly low.  I guess I'm not really comparing apples to apples though; I haven't shopped at a regular-priced Carter's store yet. I have purchased Carter's clothes everywhere from Kohl's to Costco to Ross, and I would expect to see lower prices at Costco and Ross in particular, but I guess I would've expected an outlet store to have the same or lower prices. They do have regular sales, and you can use coupons on top, so I guess that's where you'd really start seeing some savings.
