When we walked into this dimly lit parlor, I expected the worst. The beige walls and tiles didn't scream," Welcome!" and the frowning hairdressers followed suit. I wrote my name down on the scraggly notepad, and waited for them to holler my name. When my turn was finally up, I got a head massage that feels like someone digging there talons into your scalp, looking for a prize. The combing of my hair was similar to a person using there teeth to comb out the knots. The hairdressers talked to each other about smoking and respiratory failure, and AARP. The only communication I got from my hairdresser was, "You got some thick hair, babe." They told us to come again and walked away. Word of advice, if it's between a hobo washing your hair with some soap from the dollar store and STYLE 5 washing your hair, go with the hobo.

I've been coming here for 3 years. Great place and Rachel is the best! I'm never disappointed by my cut & I look forward to going over there and chatting with everyone. Usually a very short wait or none at all. I moved from Henderson and still drive 20 minutes to go see Rachel.

Great environment and great price. Ask for Zulma or Rachel. Zulma can do a killer fade.
