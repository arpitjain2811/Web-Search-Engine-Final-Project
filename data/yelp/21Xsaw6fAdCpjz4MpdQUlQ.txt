Come on no one has ranked Filberto's yet. THAT'S A DAM SHAME! I used to rock Filberto's BACK in the day on trips to see friends in Arizona. This PLACE WAS BOMB DUDE! You got some BOMB ASS BREAKFAST BURRITOS. Anytime in the day. You got a lot of burrito for your money too. Even living in LA and having been to Mexico a number of times Filbetos is TOP NOTCH Mexican food!

Huge burritos! Good, with one exception! Got my husband a chorizo burro, and by the time I got home with it, red grease was dripping out of the bag! That was gross!

Living in AZ for years I got to know Mexican food. I mean I really got to know it! Filbreto's stands as one of my favorite Mexican spots on PLANET earth. Yea, I saw the news reports where they made the workers open the fridge and they found the 40oz bottles of Corona that only makes this place more AWESOME! Yea! Filberto's Rocks.
