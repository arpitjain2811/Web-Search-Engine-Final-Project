I love this preschool! My son attends this wonderful school and he enjoys going every day.  I took a long time choosing his preschool this time, and this was by far the best one I saw. The teachers are experienced, caring, talented, creative, and responsive. Parent involvement is high, and the staff is great. When you walk through the doors, you know you are in a place that truly cares about children and their development. I am so glad I found PVCS!

My grandson has attended this school for 2 years and it is wonderful. The owner, Terry, knows every child and interacts with everyone in a warm and positive manner. His teacher, Kim, is fantastic and is always looking for the "teachable moment." I have been an educator myself for 30 years and I highly recommend this school!

This preschool is amazing!  My daughter has been going here for 2 years now and absolutely loves it.  She never wants to leave.  The parents can get as involved with the school as they want and the entire staff is caring, knowledgeable, creative and hands on.  The kids learn so much from social interaction and problem solving to everything needed to start kindergarten.  This is definitely not a sterile environment that only focuses on academics.  They focus on the whole child and learning through play is a big part of it.  I am so grateful to have found this school after an exhaustive search.  Our kiddos are only little for a short time and having them in such a nurturing environment that encourages play and socialization as well as academic skills is the best possible thing I could have found.
