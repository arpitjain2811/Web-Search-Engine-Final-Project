This salon is not a place to get your nails done. The day after getting my nails done they started to chip and look horribly done. They did not paint all the way to the cuticle and told me my nails were ugly.

Amazingly friendly , not overly expensive, I have had 0 lifts and breaks since coming here in July. Kid friendly, and always relaxing .. I absolutely love this place..
