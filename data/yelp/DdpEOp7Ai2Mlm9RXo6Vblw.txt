I Love this place, everyone is really nice. I see Esmeralda every two weeks. I am very pleased with my nails. I love the nail art she does. My hubby was having a bad pain on the bottom of his foot Dr prescribed meds and nothing worked. He went to see Esmeralda and she solved his issues. He hasn't complained of his foot hurting since. The only problem is he no loves getting pedi's. I find there prices to be reasonable to other places. I suggest everyone go see Esmeralda!!!!  The directions here are incorrect. They are located on Nellis and Stewart behind USwirl and next to Cici's Pizza.

I am a guy who hates having anyone touch feet yet I realize the importance of having healthy feet so my place of choice is Kiki's now and yes Esmeralda is my favorite employee to see she's confident and make sure the my feet feel the absolute best they can be.

Just got a stone pedi here. It was amazing! They really take their time and massage you thoroughly and they pay attention to detail when painting your nails. Prices are very reasonable. Definitely going back!
