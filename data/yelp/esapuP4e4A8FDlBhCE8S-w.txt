I wouldn't normally consider Quizno's to be comfort food, but there's something comforting about having a sandwich here before boarding my flight home to Atlanta.  There are lots of other options for food on this concourse and I always bypass them all for a sub. It's unfortunate that you pay a premium for eating in the airport.  A regular combo costs more than $10. Sometimes I guess it's worth it, though. Especially when it makes you feel sooo good inside.

This place is great for a quick meal before boarding to leave Vegas.  They have a tuna sub, which I appreciated since I don't eat meat, only seafood.  Service was quick, they got my order right.  Downgrade one star is for inflated airport prices.  Highly recommend.

This was a Quizno's @ the McCarren International airport in Las Vegas. Extremely nasty place...I could not even eat half of my sandwich. Everything was falling out of it. Also, they didn't have everything on the menu that Quiznos usually has to offer. Waste of money and stomach space for food!!!!

As of Feb 2014, all prices at this airport location have gone up by at least 30% across the board. $11 for a dinky 7.5 inch Quiznos sub? No thanks. Very disappointing! I used to always grab a chili and a sandwich from here for non meal service flights, but I refuse to support the new price gouging going on here. There's even a new handwritten sign above the soda fountain that reads "Refills are 85 cents". Come on, man!
