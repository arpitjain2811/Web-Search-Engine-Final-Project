Shawn and Ed are the best! If you need electrical or plumbing parts that are hard to find, I tell everyone to see them.  I have turned to them for years and they have always taken care of us.  They are local and often way under Home Depot and Lowes. You won't be disappointed!

This is a great small business. I have a strong appreciation for the small joints especially when they compete with the big box pricing. Sean and his staff know their shit. They're not the Gomers that you see at Home Depot. The employees are courteous and helpful. Don't expect to buy a poncho and gummy bears at the check out line. This place is the go to for all kinds of construction with no BS.
