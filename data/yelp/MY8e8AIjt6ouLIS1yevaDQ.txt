Another new sushi restaurant in Kitchener.  The interior is quite nice.  Dining at Tomoya will make you feel like you're having a meal in a fancy new restaurant - because Tomoya IS a fancy new restaurant. It's a shame their sushi isn't as nice as their decor.   For the prices on the menu, I expected larger portions that I received.  We ordered the Tomoya special maki and another roll with shrimp all over the place.  Both were tasty...but small and not worth the cost.   Tomoya offers a unique (for around here) all you can eat salad bar for $2 to go along with their meal.  The salad was pretty good.  No complaints there.   The wait staff was courteous and supper ended with a nice watermelon dessert. 3 stars because the food was pretty good - but it could have been a lot better.

This is what you would call Williamsburg's local, small and intimate Japanese restaurant.  Ambiance is relaxed, clean, and modern.  Service is slow, but friendly. Food is delicious, but pricey. You come to this restaurant because it's close to your home. It probably won't win any awards, but honestly, clean, comfortable and delicious, that's all a local restaurant really needs.

Brazened Beef ribs out of this world, Teraki Chicken is great, their signature Tomoya roll the only reason it would be to small is you just want more, all the sushi is fresh love the bbq ell,tuna,butterfish,salmon.snapper ect. So give these folks a chance. 4 FORKS
