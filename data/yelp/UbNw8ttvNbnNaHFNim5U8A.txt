My family and I think this is the best church.  So active in the community.   Very comfortable and family friendly.  A great group of Christians offering a variety of options for worship, small group, bible study and fellowship.

I love being a part of this church. There is a wonderful music program. Amazing outreach to the community and an incredible children's program!
