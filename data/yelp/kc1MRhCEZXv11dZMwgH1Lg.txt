A great resource for those who are homeless or otherwise in need of help.  The staff is kind and tolerant and the variety of services available is amazing.  Plus, it's located right next to the Maricopa County Human Service Campus.

This is a great place to volunteer and exercise some humanity.  A friend of mine asked me to tag along with him and I'm so glad I did, we've been back a couple of times to help out with the meals and drop off some things they were in need of at the time - like tampons.  If you want to get involved and help out, start here!

If you are looking for a way to help out your fellow man this year, Andre House is a great place to start. I have volunteered here on average once a month over the past year and I hope to continue. It is hard work. Like 4-5 hours of straight hustle and bustle; but it is so rewarding! Call down there or sign up online, they are always in need of a few extra hands but you cannot just drop in. Good luck! And Happy New Year!
