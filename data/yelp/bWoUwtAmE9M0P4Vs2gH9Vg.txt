One of the best dentist offices around. Staff is very caring and Dr. Hakes is always on time, does not keep you waiting.

Dr Hakes and his team, especially Carol, are fantastic.  If you are in the Tatum Ranch/North Phoenix area, you should find your way to their office.  Second on the other review where their office is very organized and they are always on time.

I have been going to Dr. Hakes for a few years now. Mostly I go there to get my teeth cleaned by the hygentist Carol. She is wonderful!  She very thorough and knowledgeable about your dental health.  I had my wisdom teeth pulled by Dr.Hakes and he did a good job, had no problems.  The bad news is Dr. Hakes has sold the practice recently but I will still go back to see Carol to get my teeth cleaned, even if I have to find another dentist.

I've been going to Dr Hakes office for ten years and highly recommend his office - especially Carol who is amazing! She is gentle and does an excellent job. I also just met the new dentist, Dr. Curtis, who is very nice and personable.
