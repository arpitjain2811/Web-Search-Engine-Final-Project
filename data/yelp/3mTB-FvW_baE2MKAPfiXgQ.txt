We will never stay at any Travelers Inn again. This hotel is run down, shabby, and not sure if I will be able to sleep tonight. I specially  asked for a non smoking room but our room smells of smoke. We were given two of the thinnest towels I've ever seen. The owners need to invest some money into new carpet and remodeling these very old rooms. We came to watch a spring training game and can't wait to leave.
