Came in and asked for a certain shoe in size 6 - 7 1/2. The girl working there today responded "We only have ADULT sizes". I have never been so insulted in my life.

Playing repulsive music containing words and images that made me want to run from the store. I was told this is what their shoppers like to listen to. Not me. Never again and I'll warn my friends.

We love this place and the staff! Mick and Kat rule. We bring our dog here! Super friendly people and fun shopping environment. I like their selection of boards, shoes and accessories. We stop by once a week.
