This is probably the Dollar Tree I went to most often while visiting my daughter in Mesa.  Sometimes she was with me, buying baby shower invitations and wedding thank you notes and household supplies, pet treats, etc, and sometimes I was by myself buying cleaning supplies to clean her less than tidy apartment or filling in missing utensils, a loaf pan, dish cloths, scrubby sponges, whatever I needed, even half and half for my coffee.  Kleenex, paper towels, a couple of nightlights, just you-name-it.  Most of this would have cost me two to three times as much even at Walmart.  I sure was glad they were here.

While it doesn't defeat 99c Only on wide variety and selection, Dollar Tree leaves so-called dollar stores like Family Dollar and Dollar general in the dust because everything is actually a dollar. This location is clean with  helpfull employees and makes for a pleasent bargain shopping expirience.
