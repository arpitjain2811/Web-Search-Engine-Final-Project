I think they went a little over the top with the Hawaiian theme. It is all the typical tourist Hawaiian stuff: surfers on the tv, nut shell necklaces, macadamian nuts, leis, etc. I like the umbrellas with the smoothie, but the cup of coffee was overpriced, and not all that special even if it is Kona.  Even the bathroom has the same lei/palm tree design as all the other tables outside... it made me think wtf. Why? They have free wifi, but sometimes it gets loud, and I didn't find too many places to plug in. Its located in the new SanTan mall so its a decent place to pick up a drink while shopping if nothing else.
