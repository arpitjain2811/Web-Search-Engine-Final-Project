The BEST Sushi in town by far. All others hail in comparison. Head chef Kim is and the staff is very personable. The sushi itself is unbelievable. Best place in town, i've eaten at many sushi places.

The happy hour....is nice and long 2 thumbs up. We ordered 5 specialty rolls and 2 bombers and our bill was still 50$.  The worst part is that we walked away hungry.   If i spend that much I want to be full.

came here a year ago and it was decent. today I came back and the customer service and food quality has dramatically declined, we were the only ones in the restaurant and our waiter was very distracted and barely paid attention to us, there were flies and the floor had not been swept in quite awhile. the sushi was cheap but taste cheap as well, warm and did not seem too fresh. Probably won't come again.
