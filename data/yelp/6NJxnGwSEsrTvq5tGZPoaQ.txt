This is a great place for home furnishings.  They sell pictures, plants, outdoor decor...  I have found some great deals here, and it is nice to go and look around.  There is a lot of fragile items though, so I need to keep an eye on my children at all times.  Most of the time a stroller keeps them contained though. I have found the clerks really helpful and friendly.

I went in on Saturday looking for an item similar to what I had purchased at a different Kirklands, only larger. To my amazment they had it. It was on sale and when the cash register scanned the bar code it came up cheaper. She didn't question it, she just gave me the lower price. Amazing, that's what I'm talking about. She did my exchange no problem and she was really friendly. This was my first experience at this Kirklands, and I like it more than the one I regularily go to, I will definately be back.

I always find great stuff for the house here. The other day I was looking for my daughter's new place and found stuff for me as well! The prices can't be beat. They now have a rewards system where you get points for all your purchases and can earn rewards certificates. They don't make you carry a card for it either which is nice since I have 50 plus cards for all these rewards programs everyone has! They are always really helpful as well. If you are looking fo something unique for your home at a reasonable price, this is a good place to start. Especially for holiday items!
