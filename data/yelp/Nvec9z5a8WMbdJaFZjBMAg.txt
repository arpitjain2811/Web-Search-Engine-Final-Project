Was recommended by a long time Gilbert resident.  Cory has treated my family and our cars right.  His shop is the kind of local business that doesn't advertise but relies on word-of-mouth referrals.  It's not just the quality of work that satisfied me, but the treatment and price.  When I pointed out an issue with some work I found 2 weeks later, Cory had it fixed the same day I brought the car back.  When my teenager had an accident, I sent her to see Cory.  When my elderly father needed some body work from a parking lot hit-and-run we took his car there and Cory buffed the whole car for no additional charge.

I found Gateway Auto Body about a year ago.  I was recommended by a friend and each experience has been better than the last.  I've had to get a few things repaired over the last year and every time the service is always excellent, fast and efficient and the prices are very competitive.  I cannot recommend Gateway Auto Body enough.

Came in to get my car hood latch repaired after going to 2 other auto body companies. Very great experience from quote to repair. Would recommend to anyone!
