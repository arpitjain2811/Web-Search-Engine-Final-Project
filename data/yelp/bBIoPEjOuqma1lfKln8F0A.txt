I recently moved and just started going to this location.  As I am a creature of habit, I resisted going and kept going out of my way to my old hair stylist that had been cutting my hair of the last 5 years. So, I finally broke down and decided to give this place a try. I a pleased to say that the stylists here are very friendly and most importantly, can cut hair very well. I have gotten my hair cut here a few times now, and have yet to be disappointed.

First time ever getting my haircut at great clips. Good experience overall. Was greeted & seated promptly. Michelle cut my hair & did a very good job. My last haircut was at a salon & I paid $35. The $12 cut from Michelle was better than the $35 cut. I will definitely be going back every 4 weeks. Great cut especially for the price.

I was in bad need of a haircut and beard trimming and my experience at great clips was nothing short of amazing. Latasha was fantastic and trimmed me up right. Will def go back again!
