What can I say, this place is an Albertsons...  Definitely not high-end like Whole Foods, but not bottom of the barrel either. It is always clean, bright, and organized. The selection is vast, and since I've seen things behind the scenes, I know they work hard to keep only fresh and undamaged food on the shelves.  disclosure: I used to work here

Good clean store with helpful staff. I wish someday there could be the perfect mix of Costco, Fresh and Easy, and a store like this, so I could finally shop in one place.

Great Place. Clean and cool in the summers. The Starbucks inside is awesome. Better than Safeway or Fry's.

I can't say enough about this grocery store. They have excellent customer service and I never experience cashier lines more than one or two people deep. They have a small selection of Organic vegetables, but the quality is very high; a decent selection of beer - beyond the usual bud light / coors light offering and the selection of baking supplies is as good as I've seen at a grocery store. I'll go out of my way to shop here.

When I think of Albertsons I always think of the sketchy one near my house in Tucson, so I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into this one. It's clean and well lit. It's easy to navigate. The line to check out wasn't long at all. I really liked their wine selection and they had my favorite Chateau Ste. Michelle Riesling refrigerated. Win!
