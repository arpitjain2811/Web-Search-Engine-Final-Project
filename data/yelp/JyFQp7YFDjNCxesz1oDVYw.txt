Nice rugs, but their sales tactics are as sleazy as they come.  Repeatedly brought coffee and donuts on sales calls, and sent small presents in the mail to butter me up, before trying to rip me off.  He sold me a six figure rug that supposedly came from a palace, but never provided me with the documentation.

High end carpets and high end service. I am so pleased and Kim treated us with Kid Gloves. Awesome. Thanks AZADI. We love our carpets.
