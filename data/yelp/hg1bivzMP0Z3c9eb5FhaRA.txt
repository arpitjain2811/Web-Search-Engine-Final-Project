This is the worst company ever. Believe me, you will regret it if you get stuck in a contract with them. They make it impossible to cancel, they demand $$$ from you, and they are rude on top of that. I have never been so irritated about a company. I am taking every possible route to get my word out there. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS AWFUL COMPANY.

Guardian has been fine as far as service goes; they've always come when they say they will, they come back for free if there is a need, and their people have always been friendly and efficient.  The problem came when I needed to cancel my service.  The house we are renting is being foreclosed on and we are being forced to move out. We're moving out of state, so I can't just transfer my existing Guardian service to the new address.  It seems like Guardian has been sold recently because when I call their Las Vegas number it gets automatically transferred to another company in Washington. I told the person I spoke with that I needed to cancel my service and he said, "Have you submitted a cancelation form?" I said, "No. What is that?" He told me, "Cancelations have to be submitted in writing 30 days prior to the end of service.  If you have another appointment within that 30 days we'll still come out and spray."  I said, "Okay... where can I do that?" He replied, "Just send a letter to the office there in Las Vegas or to us in Washington." I know that the only reason they require 30 days notice is to squeeze one last payment out of you. And making it required in writing is just ridiculous.  Obviously, they want to screw you out of as much money as they can. Do not use Guardian.  Go with someone else; someone who doesn't require written notice to cancel your service.
