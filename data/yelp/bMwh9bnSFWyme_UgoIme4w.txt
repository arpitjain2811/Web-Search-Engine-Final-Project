We enjoyed our stay here. We arrived late at night and had our baby with us. We had called earlier requesting a pack and play for our room and it was all nicely setup when we got there (linens included).  People were a bit loud at night, or maybe the walls are a bit thin? We think it was a bit of both. Mostly you could hear the people talking on the hallways but not from the room next door. Beds we're comfy and a/c was a bit loud but did their job! We liked the a/c noise actually because it "cushioned" the noise from outside for a while.  Breakfast was really nice and staff was constantly refilling eggs, beverages and other warm food. The coffee was not good at all but I think they rotate them anyway, and it's all about taste. Other people seem to like it! There is also a Starbucks across the parking lot- convenient location! Plenty of parking and not a lot of traffic. We would definitely come back!

Loved staying at The Hampton Inn & Suites! At first I was like.... I wanted to stay closer to the strip. But, now this is the place for us. Clean suites, full free breakfast and is even dog friend

Great hotel. Front desk was very friendly. It was a nice quiet place to stay. Great beds, bedding, pillows. I tried to book more nights, but they were full for the next couple of days. It is a little far from the strip, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing!
