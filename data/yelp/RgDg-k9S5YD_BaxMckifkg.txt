I really like both Chinese restaurants in town.  This one has outstanding crab rangoon.  Love the chicken with snow peas and mushrooms and General Tso Chicken.  Food is always ready in 10 minutes which is accurate.  Good place and they give you free pop.

Above average takeout with friendly staff. The sauce on the pan fried noodle is tasty. Dumplings are quite good.

We order from Chang Jiang often and have never been disappointed.  The menu is huge, and can accomodate anyone's taste buds.  The service is quick, usually ready in 10 minutes.
