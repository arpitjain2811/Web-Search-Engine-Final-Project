This is pretty standard as far as Little Caesar's go, nothing really that stands out from any other of these locations around the valley.   Though I will give credit to the people in the kitchen for the hustle on the turnaround of pizzas. So good job on the speed!

Received a new home owners free coupon in the mail from them. The only store to do so. Would have never stopped there otherwise. But i passing by and i do love pizza. ..so what did i have lose. Walking in and in less time than you say thank you i had my free pizza.  I must say that  i was very surprised with the quality and quantity. Why would anyone go to papa Murphy pay more and start your home oven in this heat . Not sure they'll be around very long. Any who I'm going to try  little Caesar deep dish next week for only$8.00. I'll review it

Promised to review Little Caesar's deep dish pizza.  Well today I stopped there at 5 pm. Customer traffic was impressive.  Very little to no waiting time. The deep dish pizza comes with pepperoni, which one small bite will give me heart burn for a month of Sunday's, the very friendly guy behind the counter promised a cheese only in less then 10 minutes.  Only took 8 minutes.  The quality was perfect. ...taste excellent.  8 large square pieces, actually 2 sections of 4 . Best deal in Las Vegas for only $8.00
