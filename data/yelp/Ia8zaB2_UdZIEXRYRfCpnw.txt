Got a great hair cut here from "Eric." My hair lays well, he suppressed my cowlick, and did a good job cleaning up my neck too. Nice job!

Went here for the first time today on the recommendation of a friend. Micah did a great job and I'll definitely be back next time I need my hair cut!

I have been coming here for about a year.  4 or 5 barbers there have cut my hair.  They all do a great job, are courteous, and the price is reasonable.  The barbers all know what they are doing and are attentive to details.  I have nothing bad to say about this establishment.  Excellent barber shop.
