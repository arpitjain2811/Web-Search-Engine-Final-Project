If you are looking for evidence that Las Vegas has a soul, this isn't it. The art is vacuous and unchallenging, not even kitschy enough to be ironically good. Mostly just little cubicles of uninspired junk-- poorly executed nudes, "gothic art" -- not to be confused with outsider art (or something actually worth seeing), walls lined with flaccid still lifes and hand blown glass figures that appear to be from the indoor swapmeet. Apparently, this place was voted the best art gallery in Vegas by locals, which I suppose says a lot about the locals.

I went to get a appraisal. They asked if I had a appt. but I didnt. I am from out of state. Brett came out from the back and offered to help. That was very nice of him. I would call ahead and make a appt. before you go in. Thanks Brett for your help. Will for sure be back.
