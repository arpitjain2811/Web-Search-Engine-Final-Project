The usual McDonald's food and prices with fast and friendly service. Go here in the morning for coffee rather than the nearby Starbucks and it's faster and cheaper. $1 for a hot coffee or around $2 for an iced coffee. This leaves you with a few more $ in your pocket you can lose, er, use at the casino.

Much lower than the competition.   Friendly customer service. We had the sweet chili chicken wrap for $3.99 (without the meal) and 2 apple pies which were on sale for $1. This is the best option at this food court.  Everything else is so overpriced.
