5 stars for the drinks & desserts.  Seriously, I LOVE happy hour and the blend that Sonic has for their sodas.  Food might be a different story if I were rating that.

Had a  bad experience last night our order wasn't even close to being correct, they mixed up everything even after I asked twice at the window if they had it right. Really bad when they can't get a cheeseburger right.
