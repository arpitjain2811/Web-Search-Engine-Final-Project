The staff at this Walgreens is amazing.  They are consistently friendly and helpful.  There is apparently a prescription program where you pay $20 a year per person, and after that your prescriptions are only up to $15 a script... This was the only store that told us about the program.  This saved us around $500 on just one prescription! The store has everything (from kitsch to Jim Beam), and everyone's pretty nice.  I would organize it a little better, but no biggie...

A full hour to fill a prescription. Seriously? I'll go somewhere else next time.

Store is always very clean and they have very friendly employees and staff.  Like the new design that they did inside the store.  Keep up the great work
