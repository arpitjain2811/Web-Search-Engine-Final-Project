Thrilled that they carry Zico and GTs Kombucha!

This Safeway always has vagrants out front. Very sketchy and somewhat dangerous. My wife and I were threatened with a knife while waking to our car in the parking lot. I would advise anyone and everyone to avoid this Safeway at all cost.

Bummer.  They no longer carry GTs Kombucha. =(

This store is close to me, but have always been more expensive than Fry's. The store itself is clean and well organized, but the biggest issue I have is the number of cashiers working. Every time I go in there,  only one cash register is open, out of seven, wait times are pretty long. They should have a self check out option. Or at least 2 registers open.
