My wife and I've taken our cars there for the past few years.  We really trust them and they are always honest and upfront about estimates, costs and then actual charges.  I recommend them to all of our friends.  They also will give you a ride to and from your house if you live close enough.

Have had my cars serviced here for the last few years. I can't say I'm wild about what they charge - but they are true to their estimates. They do good work, as I have never had any problems with anything they have fixed. They get things done quickly too, which is always good.

Once upon a time, these guys were pretty good. Times have changed. You should look elsewhere.

Stay away from this rip-off joint. Took my car there because my air conditioning wasn't working. They said I had a line leaking and needed over $800 to fix it, plus I needed a bunch of other stuff totaling $1100. I wanted a second opinion and took it somewhere else where they said there was no line leak only a bad o-ring. Walked out with an $85 tab vs $1100
