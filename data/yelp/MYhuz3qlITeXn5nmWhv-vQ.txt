Our lady did a great job with our medi and pedi, Kind of pricey about $30 but my gf lives down the street and I really needed one. Its pretty much in the middle of no where but they did have a sonic's in the same plaza .. Hey, we don't have sonic's in LA!

I live right up the road so it's close for me. Prices are not bad fill ins are 15 dollars. Full sets are 25. I think 30 for pink and white.  They do some good nail art. I haven't had a problem yet and I have been going to them since 05/2010.

I always come here to get my eyebrows done. Its very hard to find a good eyebrow place and someone you trust!   Love that its close to home and not wicked expensive for a simple request!  Im definitely a regular here.
