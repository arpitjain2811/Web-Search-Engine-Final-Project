Crannied inside a Shell Station, 3 Chiles offers the standard fare of Mexican food at decent prices. They lack a salsa bar but have a drive-thru. The service is a tad on the curt side and the food takes awhile but everything I've had so far is standardly solid. Though there's much better choices out there, it's a quick fix for that hankering for some beans, rice and carne asada tacos, no more no less.

A last ditch effort at mexican food, an effort only recommended to the truly desperate and patient.

Its just like a Federicos, Filibertos, etc but inside a gas station and the quality is for the most part the same except last time I went (today) my California burrito had a lot of fatty/non meat pieces in place of the carne asada which wasn't what I wanted. If you like Federicos, Filibertos then you will like this place because its almost the same thing and same menu. Like Young S said, it does take a while to get the food though. Not sure why.
