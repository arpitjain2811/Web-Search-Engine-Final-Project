Stopped by here since our usual joint was closed. Had pho dac biet and it was yummy. It was loaded with meat, tendons and meat balls, which is a plus and its broth was darker than what I am used to, but very aromatic and yummy. My son had the rice platter with BBQ pork chops and he liked it very much. "Mmmm, goot," he says. :o) I give them a 3 star rating because we were there at 9:15 and they werent open yet. The sign said that they open at 9:00.

Two days ago I felt drained and fatigued at the end of the workday, so I went to Pho Binh Minh - one of those "gems in rundown strip malls" - to recharge. The VERY tasty Bun (rice noodles) with grilled pork and shrimp was a great pick-me-up, and the delicious Vietnamese iced coffee gave me such a buzz that I was ready to climb the walls an hour later ;)  The experience was so positive that I went back today to try their fresh spring rolls and the brisket and steak pho; both were excellent. The restaurant is simple and spacious, the service was good, as were the prices - especially if you're on a tight budget. I guess it's just the strip mall setting that kept me from giving this place a 5-star rating, and that's hardly their fault.
