You can order your photo prints online and pick it up at the store. It is very fast, and thus the A-OK.

I this Walgreens a lot! They are great with print orders and have bent over backwards to help with prescription issues (they even called CVS one time for a medication they were out of!). I highly recommend them!

They carried a product I have been searching the high heavens for for about 4 years. I finally found it at the boots no. 7 counter. Great selection of this British brand
