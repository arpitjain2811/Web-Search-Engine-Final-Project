Came in to buy some Blu-rays, and was happy with the selection, and the prices. The place was organised , and clean. The staff were cool, and we cracked a couple jokes. A nice product varying pawn shop, with a respect for their items..check em out

Came in to sell an old wedding set, was very happy with the experience.  I did not feel  taken advantage of and got a very fair price for what I was selling, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an honest deal.
