Firehouse is  #1 of the sub shops in our area. Not the cheapest and not the most expensive but better quality than the cheapest and a better menu selection than all of them!  They will even accommodate a custom sandwich, in case, like me you still want something other than a menu item.  They have salads, a low calorie menu and  many hot & cold subs.  In addition the fresh bread, service and fancy Coke machine are top notch!  Check 'em out.

Friendly staff, clean, kool concept. Staff did not know the menu. I ordered my sandwich based on the counter guys description-- turned out to be totally different.  They gave my kid the wrong sandwich which we realized after we got home.  I will try it again though after they have been around and hopefully train their employees on the menu.
