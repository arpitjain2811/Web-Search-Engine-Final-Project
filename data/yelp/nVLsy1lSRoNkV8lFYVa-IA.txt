Bathrooms are dingy, decent Jerky selection.  Water and Gas are super expensive - tank up before you cross the desert. Lots of dirty kids in the parking lot.. what's up with that?

Whether its late at night or early in the morning Short Line Express Market is my goto stop for gas and quick cool drinks. The Staff is great and always in a great mood. I will continue to fill up my car and tummy at this location and suggest you do so as well.
