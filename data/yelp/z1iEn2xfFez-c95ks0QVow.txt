There's no such thing as painless dentistry but this place is about as close as it gets.   I once got into a heated debate with a co-worker over who had the better dentist, after several minutes we realized we both went to Cambridge Dental.  Everybody here is very professional and super friendly.  From your very first visit you will be able to tell that they genuinely care about their patients.  I'm 44 and Dr. Gaona is by far the best dentist I've ever encountered.  If I move to Tempe as planned I will gladly drive across the valley to remain a patient there.

Our family has been seeing Dr. Gaona for years. Amazing doesn't cover it. He is kind, professional and very patient with the world's worst dental patient. That would be me! His office staff is equally wonderful. I would recommend them  with ten stars if that were possible!
