Very few hair dressers have been able to give me the cut that I've asked for. Alice on the other hand is not afraid to get in there and give me the rock star layers that I love. She is not only an amazing hairdresser, she is an amazing person and I would recommend her, hands down, as the best Vegas has to offer.
