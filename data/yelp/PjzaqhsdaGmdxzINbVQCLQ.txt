He is an amazing pediatrician, very smart, has an MD and JD.  They have a very busy practice but he never makes you feel rushed.  He listens to concerns and gets along well with my would be doctor husband.

Dr. Robertson listens to "mother's instinct" and he works with me  to ensure great health for my 2 year old and 8 year old. I switched my pediatrician of 6 years to go to him and I am so mad at myself for not doing it 6 years earlier!!

Very good pediatrician. I am taking my  2 years old son since birth, I would highly recommend Dr. Robertson to anyone. I am not rating 5 star, because of even it is very easy to do appointment but it takes very long to wait.
