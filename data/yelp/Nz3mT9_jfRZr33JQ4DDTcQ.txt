Had a great weekend stay.  The owners are friendly and warm, the accommodations were comfortable, and the location is good.  Just a 20 min walk to the old town or take a quick bus ride.  There is a bus stop that is very close with many buses heading towards the city centre.  Will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Edinburgh!
