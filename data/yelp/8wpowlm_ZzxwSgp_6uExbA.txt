Nice well kept new laundry, prices are reasonable and I haven't seen a machine out of order. They have two televisions which can be a little loud at times. Two computer terminals that run linux for web browing and wifi. They also have a play area for children.

Very clean and well lit. Close to Mexican, Chinese and Italian take out. Nice TV's and computers. Best place to launder your clothes in Madison!!

As other reviewers mentioned, this place is clean and brightly lit.  Wifi worked well and two TVs were playing along one wall.  There are comfortable stools for sitting while you wait and some nearby food options as well.  If you have to leave home to do laundry, might as well come here.

Great location and it was clean and well run.  Even had a couple of old computers and a kid's play area.  As far as laundromats are concerned this would be well above average.  Free wi-fi too!
