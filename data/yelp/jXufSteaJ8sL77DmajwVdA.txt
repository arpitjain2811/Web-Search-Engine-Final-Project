Divas is a small lingerie company that is attached to The Open Door.  You have to walk through The Open Door to get to Divas.  It has some really cute pieces of lingerie, but I wouldn't say they are reasonably priced.  Also, while there is a big inventory for the size of the small space, it isn't displayed terribly creatively, rather just on racks attached to the wall.  The displays at The Open Door are more interesting.

I Love this place. It is wonderful, the clothes are beautiful and well made. All the sizes we women need. Becky the owner was so very helpful to me and made me feel great about what I wanted.  They have a party idea that sounds like so much fun that I am going to scedule one. Check this place out. It will be well worth your time.

Love it! Everytime I go in I want one of everything! Feathers and lace and satin everywhere! Definitely make sure to look everywhere or you may miss something!
