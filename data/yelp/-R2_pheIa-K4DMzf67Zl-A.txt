Being fairly new (not counting a few ill-advised golf outings in high school) to golf, I don't have a lot to compare this course to as far as conditions versus other courses I have played, but I would still recommend to most (especially novice) golfers. As others have mentioned, it is fairly flat, and other than a couple bunkers and a couple water hazards, it is a fairly "easy" course. Prices are reasonable too; even with the new price hike ($35 for 18 with a cart during peak day hours) it is reasonable compared to a lot of the Valley's more prestigious courses. The staff is friendly, clubhouse facilities are clean, even though fairly dated, and they have a small selection of shirts, bags, balls, and shoes for purchase.
