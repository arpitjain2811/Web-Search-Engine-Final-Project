I needed my hair dyed and my Hair Stylist was unavailable.  I tired Amy at Sachi.  She did a great job with my color.  I love it and have had many complements.  I definability will be going back.

I needed my hair colored, cut, and styled for Valentines day. I am a red head so I am very picky about my stylists. Amy did an AMAZING job on everything. I've gotten so many compliments on my hair already! She is very knowledgable and friendly, I highly recommend her and I will definitely be back.

Since I have been going to Amy my hairstyle has gone from the nineteen eighties to a more contemporary look. Following her advice has helped the condition and thickness of my hair. I love it!  My husband says I look ten years younger.
