For any Phoenix native who listens to rock-this station has been around forever. They are now strictly classic rock, but when KDKB has commercials or a bunk song, this would be station #2. Plus, it is hella fun to do the sound effect like swords making an X.

I listened to these guys as the Silver Spur Saloon & Beer Garden had them on. They play a great variety of classic rock: Tom Peddy & The Heart Breakers, Phill Collins & Genesis, ACDC, Crosby, Stills, and Nash, and so forth. The DJs are very bubbly and full of life, giving you all the information you need.
