If you love hair bows and have been having to make them or order them over the net...you've met your match!  Bows in every size, shape, color and style...it's the bow mecca!  If you have little girls or if you are a big girl who loves to do fun hair styles with bows Basically bows is a must see! They aren't too expensive but if you go crazy it can add up!

This store is one of the best in Scottsdale for gifts for little and big girls. The team who own and run it are super nice, super friendly and a mother and daughter team who know their stuff. I love their frequent shopper program - I've used my credit to get stuff for mom, the girls, and myself.  I visit everytime Im in

I come to this place every time I visit Arizona and always walk out with multiple purchases. This store has bows and hair accessories for all occasions and all ages of you think outside the box a little. I consistently get complimented on the things I buy there and put in my hair! Definitely a great stop if you're in the mood to jazz up your wardrobe hair-wise!
