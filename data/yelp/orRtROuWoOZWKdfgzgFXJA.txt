Not eaten in so can't say much about the decor, the exterior had always put me off going in everything time I'd walked past. But it came highly recommended from a friend so decided to take the plunge and order some takeout. Ordered the set dinner for 2. Opting for spicy tofu in place of the beef with black bean. Everything was very tasty and nothing was over/under seasoned which is a pleasant change from some of the other takeout I've had! I believe they are also MSG free which is a major major bonus in my books! Considering it's now not far from my flat. I envisage getting food from here again and probably pretty soon!
