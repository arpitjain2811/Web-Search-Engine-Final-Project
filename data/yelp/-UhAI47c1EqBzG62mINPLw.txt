I went to Shear Reflections a few months ago for a haircut. Susan is the absolute BEST!! I wanted a big change. I had super long hair and she cut it above my shoulders. I came in and told her what I was wanting to do and she was so excited to do something outside of the norm...I showed her a picture and off she went. I absolutely LOVE my hair!! After I got it cut tho, I had a hard time styling it the way that she did. So I asked her what she did again to get some tips and she just had me come back in and showed me a few different things to do with my hair. I thought it was awesome that she went that extra mile for me. I won't go to anyone else anymore when it comes to my hair!!

Love this place! Very clean & modern inside and the hair dressers are all really friendly. My wife and I have never had a bad haircut!!

I've heard good things from a friend so I decided to drop by for a haircut. I was extremely impressed with the cleanliness of the salon and how professional the staff was. Pleasantly surprised - especially with the more than reasonable prices. Looks like I won't be going to Great Clips anymore.
