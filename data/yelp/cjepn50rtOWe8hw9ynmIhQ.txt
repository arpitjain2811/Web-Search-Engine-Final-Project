I have been here several times now.  Each time I've gotten a great pedicure and they have done exactly what I've asked.  The lady running the front desk can be a bit abrupt but she has also been nice enough to me.  The women that do the manis and pedis are all very pleasant and gentle.  I typically do a walk in and I have never waiting longer than about 10 mins on a busy Saturday.  The shop is clean and does not smell like chemicals like some nail salons.  I'm so happy this place is just down the street from me so if I need a quick polish change I can pop in. Prices are resonable too. If you live in the Chandler area give them a try.

I am extremely disappointed in service I've received here lately. There are new people all the time and you never see them clean tools. Then today they changed the price on me after I asked when I arrived. SO NOT cool. I will not go back ever again!
