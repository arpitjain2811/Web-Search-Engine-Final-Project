Two stars. Thats for a few reasons: Can't get out/in the parking lot without getting hit up for 'gas money' by people who are on bikes Dirtier than almost any other Circle K I've ever been to. I'm from Arizona and they are as common as cactus. Their soda fountain sucks. I drink a ton of diet coke every day and they have the worst soda fountain I've been to. Not closed.

Nice people inside, basically just a normal gas station/mart. Only thing thats lame is thats its on a corner so its more difficult to get out of with traffic! Loves it though!!

Convenient (on the corner of a busy intersection) but competes with two other gas stations on neighboring corners.  Staff are usually friendly and they have a wide selection of snacks and beverages.  Gas is fairly priced and I usually fill up here.

Filthy store. The pumps are all tagged, beat u and dirty. The whole parkinglot was gross and filthy. There is no pride in this establishment.
