Idetail always does a great job. They're always on time, professional, and have a high attention to detail. I can appreciate the attention to detail being in the military. You can always expect great work, and I don't think I'll be taking my business to anyone else anytime soon.

Save your time by not calling and do not purchase a voucher through Yelp. I've called 3 times in the last 2 weeks after purchasing a voucher, went to voice-mail every time, left 2 messages, and no call or text back. I gave it some time and gave them the benefit of the doubt in case they were backed up or busy but 2 weeks is too long. I'll be issuing a chargeback on the voucher and looking a different mobile detailer that will answer my call or get back to my messages.
