This review focuses on the shrimp & fries meal: Just now I ate here. I was not impressed. I just got off work, and was running errands at McCarren Center. I was hungry and exhausted, and could not wait out the walk to the Walmart McDonald's.   So there in front of me was a Del Taco sign promoting a shrimp and fries meal. I can tell you that this was in reality average tasting fries with a few small fried shrimp. I should have taken a picture of it. As far as taste, I rate it on a par with a frozen dinner.    I have been to Del Taco in the past. In my opinion their cheeseburger is tasty. In general I will eat here when I get in the mood for their cheeseburger.

This is the best Del Taco in Las Vegas! The service is always great and the food is always hot and fresh. The only complaint is that it is in the flight path of the airport so occasionally a 747 will fly overhead and make your drink shake...

Open 24/7.. but you can only get breakfast certain hours. We ordered red bean and cheese burritos with extra cheese. Wow they loaded them with cheese!!  For a quick bite this place is pretty good.

Yep it's a chain, like all other chains. Food is pretty good and cheap, fries are the best, soft chicken tacos on corn tortillas yummm!
