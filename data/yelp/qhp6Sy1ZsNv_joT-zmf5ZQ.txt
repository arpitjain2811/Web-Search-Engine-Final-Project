Splatter ranch is a fantastic desert terrain to play on with a great mix of washes, trees, shrubs, small houses.  The field is big and when there are enough people the full field is so big that each team can't see the other when the start. The referess are great at Splatter Ranch and it is the safest field I have been to.  This is the only field that I will bring my family to play. Be sure to check out the scenario games once a month if you like the idea of working together and using strategy, of course you can still just blast away at anything that moves if you want too. Be sure to look at the memberships if you play much and always buy the loyalty card for $2 because you get points for dollars spent and freebies every month. Im out there often, I'll point you in the right direction when paintballs are flying Stay Low..

I brought my husband here as a form of Fun Exercise. And what a great one!! We had so much fun!  It was the first  paintball field I have been to. It was organized, had friendly staff, a large parking area and a very large field! Would definately recommend this location!!!

The paint goes faster than you think! Make sure you stock up before you hit the field!
