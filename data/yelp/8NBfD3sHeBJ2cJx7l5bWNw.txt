A nice little greasy spoon a few streets from the heart of Edinburgh that's more like a greasy silver spoon.  The venue itself is a little small and there isn't really any room to sit down, but with all the nearby parks it's not a problem. The sandwich board claimed they offer a range of "Continental Sandwiches" but I didn't really see anything you couldn't get somewhere else. They do vend Costa coffee however, which works out a little cheaper when you buy it in here rather than a Costa branch (only by about 10p though). The latte they made me was lovely.

Chequers is just one of a multitude of sandwich bars and takeaways on Broughton Street. I love Stuart B's description of it as a "greasy silver spoon" - sums it up just about perfectly! Overall, we said: "Chequers provided us with good soup and hearty rolls. We were very pleasantly surprised by the place. It lacks the elegance of some of the other local venues, but for a quick bite on the run, which was very much the order of the day, today, it gives the impression of being totally reliable."
