I met a colleague here for lunch and we dined in the Grille area.  He works in Fountain Hills and picked this place.  It's kind of out of the way for me, but the food here is solid, so I can't complain. I had the Cheeseburger Sliders and Fries.  They were excellent.  Service here is impeccable.  The servers made sure we were well attended to and kept our drink glasses full.  I'd like to come back and have dinner sometime. The vibe here is stuffy country club...so if that's not your deal, don't come here. Return Factor - 90%

Outstanding club.  Course is amazing and fun, even for a lousy golfer like me.  The service on and off the course is first class.  I am not a member but I am treated as such.  I have been here several times and will continue to return when I am in town, as long as I am invited :)
