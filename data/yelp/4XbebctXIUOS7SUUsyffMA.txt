I wish this one had a Hot Dog stand out front but oh well. Had no problem finding a Employee to guide me in the right direction on both visits which were both today. And had a great Employee in the Plumbing department make sure i left with everything i needed. KUDOS to Lowes.

I'm addicted to painting in my house.  Its becoming something group therapy worthy.   I digress.  Anywhoo, love love love the paint section there & Edgar.  He mixes everything for me even my weird color requests.  He stays current on pricing, applications & even will recommend something if we ask ! Its not very often that you get someone in a DIY store like this that have good personal customer service ! Thank  you Edgar !
