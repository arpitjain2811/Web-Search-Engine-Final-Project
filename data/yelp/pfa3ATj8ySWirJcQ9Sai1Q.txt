Horrible I got hear at 845pm they close at 930 and they did not have any food on the buffet to choose from. Everything was a 15-20 minute wait to order horrible. The attendant had a face like she was pissed that I came in. Not coming hear ever again.

I have been to this location a million times and the food is always really good. However, the lines are always really long for a really long time and they always run out of food. The restroom was spotless and the tables are always cleaned after they are used.
