Your friendly neighborhood dive bar welcome's you with open arms, and flowing beer! Just divey enough to be a "dive bar," sort of small but with enough space to have a few pool tables and a small stage for live bands. Tuesday is jam night, and you never know what you'll get here! Sometimes you'll get a band stopping in for a fresh set, and sometimes you'll get an old bag playing a pink strat so poorly that whining cats in an alley would run away. Wouldn't go out of my way to try this joint out, but worth a try if your'e in the area.

between a pit bull playing chase with a cue ball and the cockroaches under the fries basket this is not only a dive bar but a hazard. be warned.
