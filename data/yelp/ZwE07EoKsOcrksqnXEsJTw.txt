One of my many local gas/quick stop places that I frequent! It's always clean which is great and it sells Shell gasoline (which is one of my preferred brands) I really don't have a bad thing to say about the place, but if you get a chance stop by ;)

One of the few gas stations in Vegas that doesn't sell 40 oz beers or single tall cans.  Everyone else in town does, why don't you fools sell it?

You would like to give them the benefit of doubt but the constantly mark items on sale with signs but charge you more at the counter. I have complained several times but it's like groundhogs day.
