Clerk # 0772834 does not know what she is doing but has no problem being condescending to customers. Amazing how RUDE some people can be.

Expensive booze, expensive snacks, ghetto clientele, and no restroom D: Only good things are the parking structure and plenty of sunscreen available for purchase.

This is the only worthwhile drugstore near the Stratosphere (15 min walk) so we ended up here. I wish we had found this place earlier in the trip. In any case, they had everything we needed at reasonable prices. I didn't feel like the cold greedy grip of Vegas was getting me here. I was annoyed by the timeshare salesperson outside the door.
