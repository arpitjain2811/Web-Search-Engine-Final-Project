This is really the best tasting Chinese food that I've had yet in Las Vegas.  The food here is never bland or greasy like at many other Chinese places and really tastes fresh and special.  The hot and sour soup is so good that I find myself craving it whenever I think about it!  Another great dish is the Hong Kong seafood special.   The interior of the restaurant is perfectly clean, with about 10 dine-in tables, or you can also order take away.   The location is a bit hidden, in a strip mall on Decatur, on the NW corner of Lone Mountain.   Mmm, I'm wishing for a bowl of their soup now !  :-)

Best chineese food I have had for years.  Everything is made fresh and all special orders come out perfect. Best chineese food.  Gary is a wonderful chef.

Their food here is so good! It became a fast favorite for my family & I. I always got kung pao chicken. There would be peanuts & medium size chopped slices of green onion, sooo  yummy! My dad also really loved their chow fun here too. The twice cooked pork or peking pork chop..I forgot which, is really good. The food also came in a reasonable portions that always got me full. Their service is always nice & friendly when we either take out or dine in. The cook also had us taste their shrimp rangoon, so delicious. The one thing I'm not sure of is.. if they're actually still open. My mom dialed their number a couple times & got nothing. Whenever we'd pass the place it didn't seem like they were. If they're really closed..that's a bummer because their place had the best authentic chinese food!

Their website doesn't work, and I tried the phone number and it isn't in service?
