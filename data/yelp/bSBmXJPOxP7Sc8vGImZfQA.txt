Hands down the best pharmacy staff in the glendale area. They are knowledgable and efficient. They do flu shots. The store has tons of stuff that you don't need. I love that Walgreens lets you upload photos and have them printed so you can just swing by pick up and pay.  Good soda and snack selection if you are being bad on that diet.

The other day I needed some cough syrup and nothing else.  Park right by the front door, in, find what I want easy, pleasant check out, and I'm back on the road.  In the 10 years this store has been on one of the optional paths home I've stopped in a half dozen times.  Always for one or two items like cold medicine or a greeting card.  The store has always been labeled well so I can find the correct aisle quickly.
