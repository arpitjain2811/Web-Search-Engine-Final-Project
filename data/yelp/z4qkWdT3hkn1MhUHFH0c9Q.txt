If you ever drive along Northsight south towards the 101 and the Vanguard complex, you might never know there's a nice park to relax, or play a game of tennis nearby. Actually my Nav system found this one day when I was looking for a place to eat my lunch.  You go behind some the office building and there it was.  Incredible!  Two tennis courts, a dozen or so parking places and you would never know as you speed along at 45 MPH on Northsight.   Ohh BTW, watch out for the local Scottsdale PD charity drive.  They're always handing out tickets for their events around here.  LOL Enjoy!

We play ultimate frisbee here every Tuesday at 5, and it's a great place to get incredibly sore without having thousands of onlookers. Secluded behind a lot of office buildings, it's a pretty great park. Soccer, bathrooms, tennis, basketball, and dog trails. Great! :)
