Ever since going to the Joint I feel much better. The staff is friendly. I'm in and out quickly. I've recommended the joint to many people.

Emeliah gives this place 5 stars. She's so sweet, and remembers your name after one visit. She even remembers the previous stories you shared from 3 months ago. She's very caring and really strong.

Dr. Emeliah Hanson is one of the best chiropractors I have ever used! she is excellent using low force technique and has helped me dramatically after several injuries. I highly recommend you take the time to go visit "The Joint"!

Dr. Emeliah Hanson is incredible!  We found her a couple of years ago when my back problems began and I'm soooo thankful that we did!  I'm now a regular and would recommend her to absolutely anyone!  Caring, considerate, and great at what she does - I just really can't say enough about Emeliah and what she's done to help me regain my mobility.
