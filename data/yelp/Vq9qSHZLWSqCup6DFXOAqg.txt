Initially I was very impressed with this company. They were able to get a friendly tech out the same day I had issues with my AC unit. The tech seemed knowledgeable and was able to complete the repair in a timely fashion. I was even considering referring this company to my family and friends. That was until 3 days later when my AC unit went out again. The unit was displaying the exact same symptoms as before I paid them for the repair. When I called the technician and let him know that the issue hadn't been resolved, I was told I'd be liable for another service charge if I wanted to get this addressed. To make matters worse, it was at the emergency on-call rate which is almost twice their normal price. From a service standpoint this is a very poor business practice. Why do you charge the customer again when you failed to solve their problem the first time they paid you?  Sadly, I cannot recommend this company to anyone.
