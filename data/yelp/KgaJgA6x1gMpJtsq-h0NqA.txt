Brought my F250 truck in for 2 new tires, and an oil change.  price for just under $200.  Don't know what kind of crap tires they sold me, but they needed to be replaced in 16,000 miles.  When I was told this by anothern tire shop, (and looked at them myself) I went back to them with the original invoice, they looked at them and told me the excessive wear must be my driving condiotions , they offered no help, and were kinda of rude.  I'll never go near that place again!

Been coming here for years to get oil changes. They are quick, friendly, and respectful. There is always an oil change deal going on here so if you need one and are looking for a discount, this is the place.  Generally they will offer other services if they see any potential problems with your vehicle, but they are respectful of your decisions whether you decide to use them or not.
