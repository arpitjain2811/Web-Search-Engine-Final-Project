when i went to this improv i wasn't really sure what to expect, we went to the ten o'clock show and dispite there not being a big turn out of people in audence, the performers did a good job and made it entertaining. It would have been better if they sold beer there

I've gone to two Atlas Improv shows (both times, the 8pm Theatresports show). It's such a fun place to go with friends, family, or a date-- plenty of laughs, and a very talented group. Highly recommended!

Fantastic improvisational comedy. I usually go to the 8PM show on Friday or Saturday for more fast-paced improv games. The 10PM shows are great, too. They don't serve alcohol, but the restaurant next door does, and there is a connecting door, so you can bring your drink in!
