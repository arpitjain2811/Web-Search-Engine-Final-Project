I needed a haircut during our vacation and stumbled on this old fashioned barber shop.  Jan is the owner and operator.  He provided one of the best haircuts I have had in many years and I will be a returning customer.

Been going to Jan for 10 years.  I don't go anywhere else.  He works limited days but takes appointments. Walk ins are taken, but Jan is usually booked.
