Been to a lot of nail spas. I would say this one is one of the worst. To start they do not use plastic liners on their soaking tubs. Second although they do a decent job on your standard pedi. Im just not too impressed. They lacked the quality work of an experienced manicurist. We like getting our ingrowns removed and if your not skillful you can be in a world of hurt. The chairs are dated and I dont understand why the nice 42" flat panel tv is on the back of the customers. They have a nice 12" tube tv for the customers. But my advice if you like quality work this may not be the place for you. If you like cheap you get what you pay for. I wont even bother coming back.

They are under new ownership and management. Excellent place to have your nails done.  Very clean,  awesome staff, the manager Danielle is amazing! She is a fabulous nail tech and she is a very sweet person. I won't be going anywhere but there. Very reasonably priced also.
