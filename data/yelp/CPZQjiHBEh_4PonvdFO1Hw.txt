-Store sign falls on a customer with the Store Manager and his two giggling minions just a few feet away. They continue chatting and laughing. Very professional, huh? -The incident is pointed out to the Store Manager and he shrugs it off. Why is this guy a Store Manager I wonder???? -During a previous visit, there was obvious tension between TWO MOD (manager on duty). I speculate that they think they are invisible or that customers don't notice this ongoing drama at this location. -My point is that the store manager sets the tone to the store environment {ie - neat store, friendly employees, service, etc.} and this one needs a NEW Store Manager. There are many other grocery store choices, I wouldn't bother stopping here again regardless of the prices, location, etc.

I love the fact that I can pop in for grocery items and a few essentials and not have to go to the huge super center. Employees are always friendly, store us clean, and great parking!

Great little store with everything we needed! Check out was a little slow, but very well organized store overall.

Disappointing visit today... empty container of sani-wipes, opened & half drank gallon of milk in the freezer section (disgusting!) Always clean, never busy, friendly staff.
