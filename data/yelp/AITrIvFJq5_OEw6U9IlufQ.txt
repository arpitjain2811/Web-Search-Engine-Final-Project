I have known Chelsea for a couple of years;  seen numerousl people who she colors their hair and it looks great.  Her haircuts and styles are also fabulous, our whole family benefits from her talent.  She is a fantastic lady who is fun loving, hilarious and compassionate. On top of all this her prices are very reasonable, you have to give her a try. You'll love her!!!

I am the happy owner of a new pair of lucious lashes! They look amazing and I am officially hooked. Thanks Chelsea, I look forward to seeing you in 10 days for my fill. (She has an incredible offer for 3 fills per month.) That means, they will look perfect all month long.. Every time I bat my lashes, I will think of you.

I just got an amazing haircut and style from Chelsea, she listened to everything I said and asked questions to be sure I got exactly what I wanted. Her shop is so cute and she was friendly and really talented! Thanks Chelsea, you'll definitely see me again :)

Ever leave the salon looking and feeling like a million bucks, only to wash and style it yourself and realize you can't maintain the look? Yeah, used to happen to me too. Now that I go to Chelsea at Glass Hair & Lash Bar, that doesn't happen anymore.  Not only does the style look great when I leave, but Chelsea always gives a style that I can maintain on my own.  She also did my "wedding hair" and looked stunning! I would give her a million stars just for that alone.  I highly recommend this salon - You can't ask for better!!!!
