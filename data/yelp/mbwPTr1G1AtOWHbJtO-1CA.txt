This review is for its catering services. We needed to feed 50 hungry car salesmen at a 7am meeting on barely 12 hours notice, and the owner Amy Mangione came through with flying colors. She didn't so much as bat an eye at our request and met us at the crack of dawn the following morning with a beautiful spread, including a bagel assortment, salmon with capers, bacon, sausage, eggs, juices and a heaping platter of freshly-cut fruit. Her attention to detail was clear; even the cream cheese was displayed in individually-sliced pats on a glass tray with strawberries in the center. In a pinch, she even brought tables for us to set up a buffet. Everyone enjoyed their breakfast  and there were lots of smiles and laughs all morning. Can't wait to use Amy's services again.

We needed a place for a quick and hot breakfast.  We got the hot breakfast, but it wasn't so quick. Coffee was good, but getting a refill was a bit of a challenge. If the restaurant had just ONE more waitress, it would be a huge improvement.  The hash brown potatoes are very good and you should order them on the side if they're not already included in your entree.  Also, the bathrooms are somewhat inconveniently located...you have to leave the restaurant and go to the back of the building to use these facilities.  If you want a pretty good breakfast, and have PLENTY of time to spare, then this isn't a bad choice. But if you're in a hurry, find someplace else.

This place has closed and Maria's Caf√© is now in the space.  The owners decided to do catering exclusively and closed the restaurant portion of the business about 18 months ago.
