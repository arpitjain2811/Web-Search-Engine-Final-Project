Though I've known Dr. Nick for longer, both Dr. Nick and Dr. Sara are fantastic people and true professionals.  Dr. Nick is not only knowledgeable, but does an incredible job with adjustments.  I've never been more at ease with a chiropractor than Dr. Nick.  Anyone in the Waunakee area looking for a chiropractor should look no further than HR Chiropractic.  You're in great hands, pun intended.

Both Sara and Nick do a great job and actually care about their clients. I have gone for help with everything from serious back pain to little "twinges" in my shoulder.  Always able to help and provide advice to help down the road.  Highly recommended!

I've been going to this clinic for about six weeks and every time I have had an excellent experience. I've seen both doctors and they both are very knowledgeable, in tune with my injuries, and have helped me greatly.  Office is very clean and comfortable and they have very flexible hours (willing to do a few appts on the weekend.)
