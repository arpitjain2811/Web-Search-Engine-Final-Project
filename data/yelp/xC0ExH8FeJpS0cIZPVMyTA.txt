Let's just say these people are sharp. I mean they really know how to cut to the chase and get the job done. I'll even take a stab at it and say they are the best in Phoenix.  Serrated. Pairing. Steak. Filet. You name the knife, Pro Edge will sharpen and shine it for you.  But don't. Really. Don't. Don't do your Anthony Perkins impersonation for them. Apparently they've seen it before. Thousands of times. Well. So, I've heard.

These guys are amazing.  They do all the work on-site in a mobile "factory" and will even give you loaners if you need them while they work.  Outstanding service.  They use diamond-edged equipment and the blades stay sharp a long time.  They restore my blades to even better than the day I bought them.  They also sell knives -- really nice international brands that chefs use.  If every business was as good as this one I'd be a happy camper :-). Great value, reasonable.

So you think those knives you got your spouse for Christmas three years ago are still awesome huh? But why can't you cut a freakin tomato without making squishy sauce... because those awesome knives are no longer awesome. They're dull, guaranteed. Do yourself a favour and get those bad boys sharpened up! It's way cheaper than buying new ones and so much easier. Pro edge rolls up to your house in their truck and for $60, ten of your knives are brand new again! In like 15 minutes!! No reviews here since 2010?! Well the previous reviews still stand true, Pro Edge is awesome.
