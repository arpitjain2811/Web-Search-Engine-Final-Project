Called up Garrett, and did a basic detail on my Acura. All I have to say is WOW, he does an amazing job! His attention to detail is great, even the door jams were clean! Would HIGHLY recommend if you are looking for a local detailer!

Garrett did my 2007 Denali.  My carpet is cream and had really bad stains!  Garrett used his professional grade carpet cleaning equipment and my carpets look like new!  I know there is not that soapy residue left on my carpets and they will stay cleaner longer!  I will use Auto Addicts Detailing again and again!  Every area, large or small received detailed attention.  It really is a Professional Result at an Affordable Price! Awesome job! Thank you Garrett!

Called Garrett and set a time to get the car done.  Life got in the way and had to move the appointment.  Garrett was more than accommodating.  Dropped my Mazdaspeed 3 off around 8am and Garret went to work cleaning, detailing, and clay barring the car.  I picked it up about 4 hours later, and the car was in amazing condition was well worth the money spent.  I'll be taking my BMW M3 to Garrett as well.  Very impressed with the quality of work and for the price and location, you'd be crazy to look elsewhere if you're in Tempe. Thanks!

Garrett did a great job! My car is looking brand new! My car really needed some work and just a few hours later it was sparkling. He's very thorough and professional.
