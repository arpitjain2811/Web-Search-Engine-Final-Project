They have a really big selection, and I loved that they used nice fresh looking fruit. The only issue that I had is that usually you can find on the menu a "lighter" smoothie... you know,non fat milk, sweetened with splenda, or just not adding extra sugar. Didn't really see that on the menu. I'm sure they can make it that way, but still, I want it to be nice and obvious for me. I guess I'm just spoiled like that.  The Acai smoother I got was great, hit the spot perfectly.
