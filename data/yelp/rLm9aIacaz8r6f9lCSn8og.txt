A friend recommended this place and they seem to be very friendly and HONEST.  Took care of our cars last week and did a very good job.  Thank you.

Issac just went completely out of his way to assist my daughter and son-in-law when they were broken down across the street.  They needed a new battery (they didn't know it at the time, car wouldn't start after filling the tank), and Issac came over, diagnosed the problem and got them a new battery and on their way. Since they are new residents to Tempe, it is a relief to find an honest mechanic who is willing to go the extra mile to gain patrons.  Thank you Issac, we will be sure to return for future mechanical work on the Honda Civic (2007).

thought id go and see if i could get my car looked at because it was sitting not far from the area and was treated very bad, the mechanic didnt want to answer questions i had, and or had no customer service skills what so ever.
