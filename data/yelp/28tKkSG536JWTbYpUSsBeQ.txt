The service was wonderful!! I told the sales person what I was looking for and she found it right away. I was there for only five minutes.

i may have gotten a fabulous pair of shoes here, but the service was not. being a saturday at fashion show mall, the department stores were full of people and i couldn't find the right shoes, or anyone to help me. desperate to find a pair of shoes for the night, i went into bakers. there was a big sale, a lot of shoes were like 40% off. the salesperson was incredibly rude and i felt rushed. she didn't act like she wanted to help me at all. it was so noisy in there, that when she asked me if i need some extras to come with my shoes, i had to ask her to repeat herself. as if it exhausted her to say it the first time, she said it quicker to me and more annoyed. i just said no because she was so horrible at her job. thank god i never ever shop at bakers. this is my first and most likely only time coming here.

I went on a Friday but it wasn't too busy (around 6 pm). I had gone to the other bakers but they didn't have the shoes I wanted. This Bakers had the pair of shoes I wanted on hold.  They were really nice about everything. I noticed scuff marks on the bottom of the shoes so they gave me another pair. I noticed that the gold metal accents were scuffed so they let me switch them with the other pair. Great service and great shoes! They even had a 30% discount on everything, on top of the sale on the pair I wanted!
