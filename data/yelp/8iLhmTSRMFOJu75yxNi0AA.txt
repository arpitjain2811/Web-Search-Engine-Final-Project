My main reason for entering this shop was curiosity. Organic? Pleasures? An organic sex shop? How does that work then? So my friend and I curiously entered.  The shop seems almost Gothic like and stocks some really interesting items. The whole idea behind the shop is that everything is as organic and non toxic as it can be. This includes underwear, bath products and ahem, sex toys. They stock the most beautiful corsets, pricey but lovely to look at. Everything just screams of high quality and sophistication.  Its a great idea for a shop, and it works brilliantly. It is along the same lines of Ann Summers but in a much more classy, elegant and better quality kind of way.

Organic Pleasures is not a sex shop, it's an eco-erotic boutique, and it was one of the first to open in the UK; an inspired idea, I'm sure you'll agree. I find shops like Anne Summers incredibly cheap and the products tacky and not at all sexy, so it really was a godsend to stumble upon this place one day. The shop is small in size, but big in its ideas: everything has green credentials, be it organic, recycled or ethical. Organic Pleasures is a joy to visit and is not at all seedy, it oozes luxury and sophistication and contains everything you could ever need for boudoir adventures. They are currently in the process of creating their own range of branded products which will fit in with their ethos, I am looking forward to seeing what they come up with.
