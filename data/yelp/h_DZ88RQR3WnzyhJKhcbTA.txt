Love coming here for my late night after party cheeseburger run! They're open 24 hours and the service is usually fast and friendly!

Don't tell anyone but I have a weakness for McDonalds Chicken McNuggets. Today I ordered myself a ten piece and a large order of french fries. After I paid, the guy at the second drive thru window said I needed to park and wait for the fries. I said no thank you and left.

This location seems pretty good. Fast service and they haven't messed up my order yet.

Honestly I end up wondering why I still come here when I can go to a competitor that has a lager drink for cheaper then here looks nicer and kept up better even I can't use the Competitor's Wifi cause the wifi sucks here and they lie about why it is so slow here.  As well as not getting parents to control there kids when the place has no play area for them.

Well I see that they have tried better to keep this place clean they can use improvements none the less.  And I find it stupid that they removed the blinds from the south side of the building.
