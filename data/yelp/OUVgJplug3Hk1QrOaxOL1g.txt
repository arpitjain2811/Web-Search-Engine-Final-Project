This is honestly the best place I have been to for Dry Cleaning.  The price for clothing is cheap, always surpasses my expectations, and oh, one more thing.  It doesn't matter what I have brought in, suits, shirts, etc., every time I have brought it in around 5pm, I am always told it will be ready for pick up by 4pm the following day.  Always!  No complaints here, just praise, and the employee (Possibly owner) is very respectful and pleasant.  I will continue to go to Krisply Kleen!

My husband and I have been bringing our dry cleaning here for the past 3 years and we have zero complaints. The price is right and the service is wonderful. They get our things cleaned quickly and they always do a great job. Both of the employees are extremely personable and they remembered us both after only having gone a couple of times. They won Best of Phoenix in New Times for 2009 as well. We are moving out of state later this month and we are really going to miss Krisply Kleen!

I brought in the comforter from my guest room because our new puppy peed on it.  Without getting an authorization to wet clean, they washed it to get the stain out.  Stain is gone, but my guest comforter is ruined.
