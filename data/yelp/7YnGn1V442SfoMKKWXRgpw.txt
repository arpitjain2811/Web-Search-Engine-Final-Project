This is not your typical mall food.  Tomatoes features delicious sandwiches, salads, pastas and burgers.  Their fries are some of the best I have ever had.  I have not tried their desserts but they always look great.  They have different salads everyday that are fresh and delicious.

That place had great food especially great burgers! Too bad it closed! Not sure if they were going to to re-open some where else???
