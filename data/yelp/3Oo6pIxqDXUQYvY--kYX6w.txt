I have only come to this locatiopn about a 100 times or so and i cant say that there is anything to complain about. Kyle my amazing bartender is absolutely fantastic. I love the food, the drinks, and the atmosphere. There is a lot of usuals at this place and everyone gets along and chats up the night. I love it!

My husband and I have tried a few local bar and grills around Las Vegas.  Putter's definitely rates as one of the best.  The breakfast items were good and they have pretty sizable portions.  Definitely worth your money.

I'm bias because I work here. I love this bar though. It's never too crowded to get a drink. Angelina's has awesome food. Good music and lots of TV's. What more could you want?
