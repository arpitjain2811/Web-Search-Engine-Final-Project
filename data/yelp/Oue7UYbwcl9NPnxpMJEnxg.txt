These guys are the best. Very helpful and courteous. If you have questions, they will find answers and they will come outside and show you where things are on your car if you need them to. As a woman, I appreciated their assistance.  Highly recommended.

Absolutely the WORST SERVICE!!!!!!! They do not help with anything. I've been there twice in a week and both times I've wanted to pull my hair out. They are extremely rude. FIND A DIFFERENT AUTOZONE.

Excellent customer service. Went in to see about recharging the air conditioning in my car. Amber was very knowledgeable and friendly. She came outside to help us with the recharge. She informed me about some other minor things I should keep an eye on. I've been driving the car for a few days and the air conditioning is doing great.
