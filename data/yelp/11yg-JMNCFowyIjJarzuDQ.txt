Delicious food (their burgers are seriously the best fast-food burgers)! The service here is fine, the prices are a bit high, and this location is nice and quiet. All-in-all, an okay place, especially considering it's fast food.

Hardee's in Madison is kind of a tradition for my family whenever we drive through town.  We do not have a Hardee's where we live so it is kind of a treat for us.  Simply put, the food is better than Mc Donalds and the deals are comparable.  The service is not quite as quick but your food is fresher when you get it.

It's pretty good, but it is expensive.  Think Culver's prices.

Really great value! Best fast food burgers in town, better than culvers. Went on a Thursday and thick burger combo was $6 bucks with tax! Burger was big tasty and messy. Fries we're hot and seasoned nicely.  If your thinking red robin burger without the sit down price tag, come here and you'll be pleasantly surprised :)
