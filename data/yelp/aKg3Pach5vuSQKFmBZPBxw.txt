This place use to be known as princess nails but now are known as carefree nails (new owner?). My mom got the chocolate pedicure and loved it except they did not remove the ingrown on her big toes very well. Other than that the service was good

Even on a busy 4th of July they got me in right away and gave me exactly what I asked for. I will definitely be back. My nail tech did a fantastic job with gel. By far the best design I ever had and not too much out of pocket!
