Working out here is my first choice compared to the competitors. Usually I'm on this side of town performing photoshoots for my clients and it's just a hop skip and away. The location is great and the staff is very friendly. The facilities are very clean and I enjoy the atmosphere.

Fantastic Gym. Great atmosphere. Staff is very helpful and friendly.  I actually converted from LVAC to Anytime Fitness due to its ease of use and overall workout experience. I do not have a lot of time to work out, but Anytime fitness allows me quick access to the facilities I need to stay fit and stay in shape. Its 24hr, go whenever I want, type set up is also very convenient and an absolute plus for this gym.  The staff is very helpful, but to be honest I usually go to this gym after hours. I had the opportunity to meet with the owner of this particular gym facility...great guy...and based upon our conversations this gym is in very good hands in terms of being kept clean, efficient and up to date. If you are looking for a great place to go and workout to keep with a hectic lifestyle, then I would highly recommend this particular gym facility.

I have been going to this gym on and off since 2009 I think. Throughout all this time it has maintained its updated and clean look. They have all the necessary tools to get in shape, the management team is great! Highly recommended place :)
