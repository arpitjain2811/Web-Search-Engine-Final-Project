It's a rip-off for a simple passport photo. It's 12 bucks-- way too expensive for such a low quality passport photo!

This store was closed before the posted hours the last two times I went. We went to pickup a Redbox DVD and wasted the trip even though we got there 50 minutes before closing time.

A pretty nasty little Walgreens.
