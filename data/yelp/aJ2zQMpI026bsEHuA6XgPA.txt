Yes, yes.  They have wonderful sandwiches, soups and specials.  The wine is priced right and the place is clean, and comfy with a great staff.  A great place to go for a quiet glass of wine by yourself-you won't regret it.  Or, take a group of friends, you will be treated right.  Order a case of your favorite wine on your way out, better prices than Bev Mo!

Small plate heaven. We had crabcakes and seared scallops. Both were delicious. The cheese boards are excellent. Plus, the wine by the glass selections are wide ranging and well chosen. I had a white Priorat for the first time, and a Corsican red. Both were delightful. Good service and ambiance as well. Definitely worth a visit for foodies and wine lovers.
