It's a good deal for the price: lunch - $6+ dinner - $7-13 And of course, for this price, you have to accept that it is not the most authentic Japanese food you will have.  However, service is good. They provide complimentary edamame appetizer for dinner orders, where as most places charge you for that. Nice interior decor for a restaurant like this. I'd say it's a place for a quick bite or light dinner.

Really enjoyed the crunchy, spicy tuna roll.  The Cowboy roll was good too: tuna, salmon, and shrimp.   The service was quick and personable, with a downscale decore.  Its clean,  and tasteful inside, but a long, long way from hip and trendy like most other sushi places you see around Madison. I recommend stopping by if you are out and looking for something quick and easy.

We LOVE this place! We have had take-out, lunch, dinner and celebration dinner here. The service is great. The food is good and the price is great! We are from SoCa; sushi is an important part of our life. My son, 8, has been a fan of spicy tuna hand rolls since he was 5. This is the place he chooses the most to celebrate. And yes, he has been to the other "high" end places. I like it the most because this is where we are treated well and fed royally.

Good food, good service. reasonable value for the dollar. My Wife and I split a sushi combo. Two chef's rolls, two hand rolls, and two pc sushi. All were tasty, included generous salad, and house (miso like?) soup.
