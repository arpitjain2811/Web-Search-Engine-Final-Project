Three stars only because the food was actually pretty good. The buffet, in comparisons to others I have been to in Las Vegas, was small and didn't have that large of a selection, though. We were seated relatively quickly, however, our server came to see us once the entire time to find out what we wanted to drink and that was the last we saw of her. She didn't stop by to see if we wanted refills, if we needed new utensils, or just to see how we were doing. I didn't like that at all.

We came here on a couple times on a Friday night and had their Prime rib AYCE for $12.96 (We used the Caisno Guide BOGO) - The buffet is very simple. American, Mexican, Salad bar, pizza, soup and grill.  - The best part about this buffet and the only reason why we come here is just for Friday nights for their Prime Rib. - Great prime rib. They actually re-grill a somewhat rare slab and it is amazing! Very flavorful, and not dry. I love it.  - They make fresh cheeseburgers. We order the cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushrooms with freshly fried french fries.  - For the price of about 6.50 per person, this buffet beats any fast food American restaurant.  - Free sodas with buffet.  - Always empty so service is always nice.  - I don't touch much of the other stuff. It's more like AYCE prime rib and burgers haha.  - Chicken soup is very salty.  - Compared to Feast buffet, Feast is better.  - 11.99 Fri Sat is for Blue Ace members.  - Closes at 9pm Friday. They start cleaning the buffet at 9:15 and it closes at 9:30pm

Expecting the worse but was pleasantly surprised. They grill the hotdogs and burgers to order with fresh French fries. Had a 2 for 1 coupon and left very satisfied.
