I love this Old Navy.  It is big and clean.  They have a large sale selection too (BONUS).  The employees are always friendly.

I love Old Navy for the sales really.  Things priced at the regular price are not quality enough to warrant the price.  This location is good, I hate the clearance area it's always a mess.  But this is without a doubt the friendliest location in the west valley.
