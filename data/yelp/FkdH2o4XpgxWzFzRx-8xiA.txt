I like to support our local-small businesses and this is a new business where they sell women's clothing and accessories.They have a variety of styles and more to come. My girlfriend loves it! There's not many small local clothing boutiques like this. Plus, It's at a great location on Sunset Rd! Usually, we'd have to drive across town or to the strip to find a store like this. I was lucky enough to walk in the day they opened and they have free sandwiches for their grand opening lol
