It looks alot better than it tastes... When I first saw this place.. I was in heaven..  It's great how they present everything.. They have alot of stuff there..  We tried a crepe with gelato. The crepe was just OK.. for the price.. and my expectations based on the look of this place was...it was a letdown.  The gelato was OK as well. This place isn't cheap. You're in the palazzo, and expected to pay top dollar. The chocolate syrup used was mediocre.  I would go back to try something else though.. something HAS to be good.. right??

The coffee here is really good! I had a Hot Vanilla Latte which beat Starbucks by far. I had it 2 days in a row and both times it was good and not burnt. With other coffee shops, it can be a hit or miss with burnt coffee which is not good.
