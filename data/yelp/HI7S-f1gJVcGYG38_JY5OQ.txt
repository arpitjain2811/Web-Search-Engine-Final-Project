Got a cheesesteak and regretted it immediately. The meat is tasteless and floppy. At least I didn't get sick!

Unbelievable find at the Las Vegas-NORTH food court. I always get my Subway, but decided to go a different route that day. To my surprise, this Las Vegas Great Steak & Potato was pretty good and super bang for the buck. I never really seen a Great Steak & Potato serve such a big sandwich. So, a LARGE great steak sandwich is $10, but it is like more than a foot long. So if you are resting your foot from a marathon day of shopping at the Las Vegas-NORTH outlet, you can re-energize with a LARGE great steak sandwich and order of fries. If you need more flavoring, you can sprinkle their extra seasoning.

Bad service with very bad attitude. We don't own anything don't give me a strange look.
