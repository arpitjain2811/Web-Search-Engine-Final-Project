Great donuts especially when they are hot.  Not too sweet.  Cheap.  My new breakfast place.

Yummm... These donuts are great... The cinnamon sugar donuts remind me of the churros in Disneyland! Reasonably priced too. What a nice quick breakfast or an afternoon treat!

These donuts are the best and at $2.50 for 7, everyone should give them a try.  They are made fresh, fast, and taste so good when they are hot that I almost ate them all before I pulled out of the parking lot.  Owners are super friendly!

Tried this truck out at First Friday this month. Enjoyed the yummy donuts but what really Wowed me was the service. They came out with a smile serving the yummy cinnamon donuts and offering coupons for the next time I checked out their truck! definitely worth checking out.

These donuts are UNREAL. I mean, lets be real, is there anything better than fresh and hot donuts? Try the "Omar Special" you won't regret. For only 2.50 (or 3.50 with 2 toppings) for a set of 7, you can't go wrong. Seriously though, go here. YUM.

So goddamn good. Its the complete opposite of Teen Wolf 2, but in your mouth.
