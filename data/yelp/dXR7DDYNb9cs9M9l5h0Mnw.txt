Got a massage and facial with Beth...she was professional and did a great job. The massage especially really relaxed me and worked out my knots. There is some noises here and there from hairdressers talking loud since it is located in a salon, but you are in a private room so its not too bad.

Destiny gave me a great massage!  She was very nice and I would definitely recommend her to anyone.  Thank you destiny for fighting with my crazy shoulder knots!

Beth is the bomb. Best lash gal in town. My lashes look AMAZING and feel great. She knows her stuff. And keeps them healthy at the same time. I recommend her to everyone. La la love her.

Went in for a message with Beth. Was a great message, she concentrated on my trouble spots. I left feeling fantastic. I will return.
