I love this spa and Rochelle is the absolute best! I've had several treatments  here and now I only go to Rochelle. She does an amazing job with brow design, facials, peels etc. I wouldn't go to any other spa in Scottsdale!

The Village at Gainey Ranch is the best! Great environment, friendly staff, many amenities. I get a great workout in here as well as take advantage of the excellent spa.  Snow is my favorite for my manicures and pedicures.  As for my hair cuts, Crissy rocks!
