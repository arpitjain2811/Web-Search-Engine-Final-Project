GREAT new location!  I am amazed how many Starbucks are in the Scottsdale area but here's another one!  The new one has a great layout with a good number of indoor seats.  It also has a drive through which is super convenient!  The drinks are made well, which I have come to expect from Starbucks and the baristas are helpful!

Great new location, definitely a plus for the neighborhood.  Fast service, friendly staff, and great drink.  Can't beat it on a summer day like this.

The food and beverages are always predictably good, the staff are always predictably friendly, and the seating is very much adequate. My only complaint, otherwise I'd give 4 or 5 stars, is the Internet access is super flaky. I'd come here to work but after far too many lost VPN connections there is absolutely no way I could trust this Wi-Fi service with my job duties. (In fact, I had to post this with the PotBelly WiFi because the Starbucks connection went down while logging into yelp.)
