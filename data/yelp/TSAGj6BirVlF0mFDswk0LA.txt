Not a fan !!! Just another company with a fancy slogan and web page !! If u have little projects it's kind of a waste of their time , is exactaly how they made me feel ! We will see if they pay attention enough to get the job done right .....

Great service! I used them for a classic car restoration 5 years ago, and all my parts I sent to Powder Coating Plus are still in great shape.  Their attention to detail and service are great.  Adam was very easy to work with.
