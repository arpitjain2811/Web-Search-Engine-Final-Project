Really tasty pretzels.  The fresh lemonade is a little tart, but yummy!  Grab a two for one coupon from the Entertainment Book!

I personally like Auntie Ann's pretzels, but we were starving and needed a snack. We ordered and both felt that the dough was overly salted. Even though I asked for a plain pretzel with no salt, there was a large salt presence tasted. I liked that the cheese sauce that they gave us was warm, and flowing.
