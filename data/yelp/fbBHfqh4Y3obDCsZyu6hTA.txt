I like this bank. Of course i visit several different Wells Fargo throughout the valley. This one i have gone to several times.  At times the smell can be over whelming inside. Just the clientele.  However the staff is very friendly, they usually always have a greeter to say  hello when you walk in and direct you where to go if you are not familiar with the  bank. Which many are not!!   I know but, remember this is Phoenix and that is why we love it  You are always  helped very quickly and they are very efficient there. As in all the other branches i go to. Also the drive up window is great as well!  The one thing that is a bit different is  the 6inch think plexy glass at all the windows for the tellers inside. Sadly enough they must have some incidents there. I like Wells Fargo, highly recommend them.. Sorry but, way better than BofA!

Probably the WORST branch I have ever been in. Average employee IQ must be in the single digits. Ugh!
