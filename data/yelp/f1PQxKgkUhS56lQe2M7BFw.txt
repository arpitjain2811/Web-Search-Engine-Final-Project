Function design does all of my 2 company's graphic design and apparel. They always have good products and great prices. I always need stuff done in a hurry and they never let me down! Would highly recommend them to anyone.

Funktion Design created/installed our company logo, enlarged it, and put it on one of our walls in our reception area. It looks incredible and makes an awesome impression as clients, applicants, and partners, enter our building.

I've known Funktion Design for a couple years now and they have done several printing jobs for me and my business.   One Saturday I called them and asked if I could send them 3 files on Monday morning for 3 retractable banners that I need on Tuesday evening. Not only were they able to get the job done, but they hand delivered the product to my door and demonstrated how to set them up! They bring great quality and great customer service!
