I work at the mall and usually eat here on my lunch breaks. The food is pretty tasty, price for a two item plate is about $6-$7, and the service is decent. I'm not complaining :)

Located in the food court at the Boulevard mall. I love this place! The have the most amazing terriyaki bowls. The bowls cost $5.89 and are plenty to fill even those with a pretty big appetite. I haven't really tasted any of the combos but they are priced between $6-$7. The only thing I don't like about it is the location. Must eat when at the mall! We even drive there once in a blue moon just for the food.
