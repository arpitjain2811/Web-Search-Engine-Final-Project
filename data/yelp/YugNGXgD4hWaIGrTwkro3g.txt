Been purchasing chlorine and muriatic acid here since they opened, nobody can beat their sale price. They have good knowledgable people and have made good suggestions to help maintain my pool.

Great customer service and great prices. Bought shock powder for half price compared to Leslie's and I was helped promptly. The gentleman behind the counter threw in a free thermometer and test kit to sweeten the deal. I found my new pool supply store.

Have used Paddock stores for 20+ years.  they closed most stores and though i had to drive a distance they didn't have an O ring.  NPS had the parts and were really helpful and friendly.

Fist time visitor. Store is bright, big and clean. Stocked with everything you might need for pool maintenance. I was there to pick up some acid and a leaf catcher o ring. I liked it so much, I impulsively bought a frog chlorine tab floater. Always wanted one! They had it. Although I didn't go for the solar powered Duck floater that lights up at night. That was a little over the top for me. Anyway, the service was good and there were actually people to help. More than I can say for the national chain pool supply store on Bell and Tatum. I bookmarked for my go-to pool supply store. Check it out!
