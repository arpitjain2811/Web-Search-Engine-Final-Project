A safe and modern facility with knowledgeable, friendly staff. They are setting the standard in Arizona for dispensaries.  Stop in a talk with Jason, Amber, Traci or Branden!

Nice nice folks, pretty consistent inventory.  Their 3 g's for $45 less $5 for an AARP cardholder is a bargain.  Highly....reccomend!

Very helpful and courteous staff.  The dispensary is new and in a great location.  If you like them on facebook you can catch all their daily specials.

Excellent service, great edibles & strains. Tho have found a seed in my bags at times; not a good sign if you're paying top shelf prices.  Overall I like the staff, the deals offered, and the way I am treated. Some deals; shake in a tube (3.6 g), mix'n'match grams, punch cards, buy X product get X free.
