Great company to work with and very competitively priced. I hired them for my April wedding. This is a company that provides great customer service. Everyone loved the open photo station. The pictures were great. We love that we have this fantastic pictorial of a guest book! We are so happy we hired them and would highly recommend them!

I hired Digital Expressions for my daughters Bat Mitzvah.  Right from the start, Laura was helpful, accommodating and easy to work with.  She had great ideas and was willing to try anything that I suggested. I bought a few hundred picture frames and she brought an extra person to our event for a small fee.  She also helped us pick 5 Green Screen backgrounds with my daughters Bat Mitzvah logo.  At the Bat Mitzvah, they brought great props and were a lot of fun with my guests. In short, I was very pleased with everything about Digital Expressions and would use them again without hesitation.
