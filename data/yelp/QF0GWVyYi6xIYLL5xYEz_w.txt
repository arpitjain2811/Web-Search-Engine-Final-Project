I came to this family-owned business (some years ago), located behind 7-11 in the little strip mall, several times for jewelry repair (it was close to work at the time). I have a beautiful white gold diamond bracelet from Zales that has a clasp which keeps coming loose. (In fact, it's loose again.) The owners are brothers, who are very nice, and they do quality work. It's a small store- you get buzzed in, for obvious security reasons. I do remember seeing some lovely tanzanite jewelry (one of my favorites but it's pricey).

I needed to fix a silver link on my wife's necklace. I found the store inYelp near my location. I walked in, they fixed it in 5 mins and I was out the door very pleased.

Lou does amazing work and quality repairs.  Pricing is transparant and fair.
