Baguette Express always offers delicious sandwiches at more than reasonable prices.  They offer a baguette, panini or baked potato with a drink for only Â£2.30 which is filling and very easy on the finances.  In particular, their paninis are delicious and I usualy go for bacon, cheese and tomato which tastes amazing once the cheese has melted and the bread is nicely toasted.  The service is always friendly and relatively fast in comparison to some other delicatessens in the area.  A lot of people slate this place just becuase it's a chain store, but I really can't see anything wrong with it.

who doesn't love Baguette Express?! This place is great. I thoroughly recommend the coronation chicken (the non-spicy one)  and brie. Ok ok I know it's odd, but who ever thought that ham and cheese would go together! The staff are lovely. Really friendly and really happy to help. This is one of my favourite places to eat when I'm studying, it's so good and very very tasty.
