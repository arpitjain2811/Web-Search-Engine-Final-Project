This clothing store may be tucked away amongst the shopping center sprawl...but what a great find!!!  When you think boutique store you think expensive or a size 2 and under.  This is not the case at this shop!  I was so excited to see trendy and classic looks that didn't clean out my wallet and that are in my size!  Fun, fun, fun going there to shop and the staff is very friendly and helpful!  Exceptional customer service!  Check it out!

If you like to shop from someone that has excellent customer service and buys local, then Clothes Minded is the store for you.  I love the fact that you can choose from such a unique selection of clothes too.  I Love it.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear their clothes or jewelry.   Lorraine Tornga
