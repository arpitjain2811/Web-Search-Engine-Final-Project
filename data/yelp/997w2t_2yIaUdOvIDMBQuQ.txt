Used these guys a couple weeks ago. They're fantastic!!! They did my whole house for $150, even getting some of the area rugs as a bonus. For that price, I figured they'd half-ass it. WRONG! The carpet in my roommate's room was almost black, but Carpet Sharks got it beige again. And the carpet in my dressing room was pockmarked with little black bits of ground-in mascara/eyeliner around my vanity. They got every single speck out!! I'm never using another service again...for reals! This service can't be beat!

Very knowledgeable and professional.  Very thoroughly cleaned pet stained carpets at a great price!  We will be using them again.

I hired them this week to clean the carpets in my old and new house. They did a great job and I couldn't beat the price! Will be using them again.
