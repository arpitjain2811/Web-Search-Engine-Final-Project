Great place!! Love the service! Didn't feel haggled to get more than I really needed. Didn't feel overcharged. Carl is very friendly and I wouldn't take my car anywhere else.

Wow! I am so impressed with the professionalism and personal care that I received here. From the very beginning I knew I was in good hands and was not being overcharged or pressured into a thing. If you are looking for personal one-on-one care for your vehicle this is the place.

carl seems to be an honest and trustworthy ASE certified mechanic. he saved me a ton of money($900) and i'll go back to him w/ all 3 of my vehicle needs. I highly recommend his shop as he's competent, qualified and his hourly rate is more than competitive. if u don't try veterans auto, you'll pay more. thx for your service carl, you have my biz!!

Took my truck in for a leak that another shop spotted during the last oil change.  Carl got me in quick and is a straight shooter.  Turned out there wasn't really a leak.  He had me in and out in less than 30 minutes.  Another shop may not have been as honest.  I would highly recommend this shop, owned and operated by a vet!

i found Veterans Auto on craigs list. I took my mini van to carl after another shop could not keep my check engine light from coming back on. he found the problem was a cracked T in the vacuum line and bad EGR sensor. he had it repaired for less than the other shop charged w/ no fix and I passed emissions easily. i'll be back for sure. honest, inexpensive ASE certified car care, thx carl!!
