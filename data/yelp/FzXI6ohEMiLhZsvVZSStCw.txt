This place is great! The staff is friendly and my kids had a BLAST.  We were there all day.The great thing about this paintball venue is that it is outdoors.  Kids and adults get to run around in 2 different settings in the hopes of eliminating the other team.  Next time we go, we will make sure to bring snacks, lunch, water and hand sanitizer.  This is a MUST try for family fun.  We will definitely be going again.

I've been there several times and have always had a blast. The staff is always very helpful and friendly. They mix up the games to keep in fun and interesting. Will definately be back.

So far, I like the spacious grounds. But, there are lots of people. And only one large field. They seem to take a lot of time between games.  The ref's were very safety consious, and watched to make sure the games were played fair. Overall my son and his friend had a good time. I would give it more of a 3.5 stars.
