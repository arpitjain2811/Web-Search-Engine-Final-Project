I rented from DeVan Management in 2011 and 2012, and had a great experience. The property was very well maintained and clean, and they were always incredibly responsive with any repairs or concerns I had. I have rented from many different people/companies, and DeVan was definitely the best in terms of communication and professionalism. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to rent a property.

It is a great company and really helped me find a property.  They are quick to get back to you, listen to your needs and go the extra mile.  Make sure you ask for Derek.

Over the past few years I've known the property manager at DeVan MGT and have nothing but great things to say.  Their properties are in great shape, the tenants have always seemed happy from what I can tell and they seem to really care about their renters.  I've always felt that they provide a service that is friendly, economical, reliable and honest.  If you're in the market for renting or need some help with MGT I would recommend contacting these guys. They're currently helping me with my property and I'm excited to continue our relationship.
