So thankful I will be able to take my sunglasses off in another day, and re join the land of the seeing.

Absolutely the best eye care available.  They have taken such good care of my mother over the years I intend to start seeing them in the new Flagstaff offices. They are prompt, explain procedures thoroughly, and their staff is friendly and kind. You really can't ask for better care.

Lots of Veterans are referred to this clinic. I went in for my routine check and whole thing was done in about 40 minutes after my arrival. It didn't exactly feel like a very thorough exam since I was a military aviator and seen thorough exams, but staff and doctors are friendly and very helpful answering questions.

Staff and Dr. Perkins are very professional. They took good care of my father, everything they did was explained and very prompt. Dr Perkins was very good, funny and easy to talk to and  understanding.  I would recommend Dr Perkins and staff to everyone at this location.
