Awesome prices, fast & kind customer service! What more can you ask for? Spent less than half what we would have at a big box store... & the guys in the dock even helped us fit the 150 sq ft into our Camry. As a weekend handyman, this place is definitely getting added to my preferred suppliers list.

I have been a contractor for 2 years in the valley.  I have bought turf from a variety of vendors, and these guys have the best selection hands down.  Not just turf, but infill choices as well.  The best part, they have everything in stock.  No waiting days if not weeks for turf anymore.  I highly recommend this company.

Way better prices than the home improvement stores and friendly, knowledgable, advice for DIYers like me. They've got everything you need for your turf install. Highly recommended...

What a great place. Nice showroom and a warehouse full of product. I just got a puppy so wanted a smaller piece to put on my sideyard. They have remnant pieces that they will sell you at a great discount. Walked out of there with a prefect small piece for 25 bucks. Thanks!! Three of my coworkers will be showing up tomorrow. :)
