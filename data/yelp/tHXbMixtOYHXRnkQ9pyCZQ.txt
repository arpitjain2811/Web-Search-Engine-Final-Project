If I had the option to give no stars I would. This agency is incredibly unorganized and will scam at every opportunity they can. They will avoid calls when it's time to cut checks to their models along with taking an additional cut from the agreed on rate. Do not try to go to either physical address listed online or in their email as you will find them both completely vacant. They will make up excuses as to why your check has not been cut, regardless if a select few other models have been paid for the same job at an earlier time. If you are a business trying to book models I would strongly recommend using another agency trusted by the models of Las Vegas. If you are a model and have been waiting for a check I would consult with a lawyer and then call leaving a voicemail in regards to the actions you will be taking.

SAVE YOURSELF FROM THIS CON-ARTIST! "John" sent me on an audition and promised me if I drive 2 hours to the audition at 9AM that he'd pay me $50 to reimburse me for my gas, not to mention my TIME! I sent him an email 2 weeks later about the $50 and he laughed it off and NEVER sent me a dime...STEER CLEAR!  His reputation is that he DOES NOT PAY!, & he certainly lives up to it! Peace
