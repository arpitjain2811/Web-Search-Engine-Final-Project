As a budget minded dad, I appreciate great quality clothing that can take a beating. This place has every kind of designer you can think of at rock bottom prices. I come here for home decor, bed and bath essentials and any and everything else that I used to frequent Nordstrom for some many years before. This place is usually busy but the service reps are pros and can easily dwindle a long line in no time. Most of the crap they sell for decor is Chinese made, which I detest but once in a while I find a handcrafted marvel from some tiny place in the world and it makes a room. Enjoy!

Ross is a hit and miss kinda place. They had very little inventory this visit. I was super disappointed. Maybe I just hit it on an off day :/
