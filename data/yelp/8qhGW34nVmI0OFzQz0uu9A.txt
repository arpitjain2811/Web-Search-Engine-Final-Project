This place is amazing. It has its own vibe that draws just the right crowd of misfit artists. You wont find a better place to spend an evening among art and artists.

this place is the best of the best of modern, macabre, alternative, dark, creepy, sexy, and beautifully put together in a wonderful little cove on 5th street, right off of Roosevelt. Perfect location. Friendly and passionate artists. Priceless art of all kinds. BUY BUY BUY!
