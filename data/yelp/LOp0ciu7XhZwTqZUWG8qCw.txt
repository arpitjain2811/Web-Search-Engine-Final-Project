Told them to replace my belt tensioner due to frequent squeaking after replacing my belt.. They looked around and said ,"nope, take the belt back and ask for a new one under warranty".. Charged be $12, and after installing a new belt, turns out they were right. Honest guys.

I took my car here to get my brakes replaced.  They did the work quickly and at a good price.  I went here on a recommendation from a friend, and now I recommend it to my friends when they need work done.

Matt at Bennett's Auto is very knowledgable and skilled with BMW's. I brought my car in and he was able to replace the belt along with my driver-side mirror fixed at the perfect timing and good price. I plan on bringing it back to have my breaks and other things done in the future. I highly recommend Bennett's to anyone who needs work done on your BMW.
