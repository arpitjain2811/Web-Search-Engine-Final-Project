Whether or not you warm to the Salisbury Centre, and the workshops and classes it hosts, will probably depend upon your level of cynicism about new age ideology and phrases such as "holistic education", "blissful healing" and "deeply transformative modality".   I generally consider myself quite open to that sort of thing - it's the inner hippie in me - but some of the classes offered here test even my limits of credulity.  However, don't let the more, shall we say, far out offerings put you off the centre as a whole, as it does have an exceptionally peaceful atmosphere and the yoga and meditation workshops I've attended have all been pretty sound - the quality just depends on the individual teacher who's running them. If you do want to "awaken the happy you" (who wouldn't?), "experience the light of Christ as healing energy", or even just find a decent yoga class, then check their website to see what courses are coming up.
