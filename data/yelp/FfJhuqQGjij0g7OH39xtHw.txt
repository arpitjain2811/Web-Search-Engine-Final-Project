Very friendly and helpful. Didn't hover over me when making a decision, but was immediately available for questions. I was very pleased to give them my business.

Family owned and operated business. They are always helpful and knowledgeable and dare I say honest! Yes there are a few honest businesses still around. Have purchased a few cameras and had prints done there. They have everything you need for pro photographers to just casual picture takers like me. I get my Christmas cards done there every year too =)

If you are a digital photographer you will find very little selection for current items. If you shoot with film you may be able to find some selection. The other competitors have a better selection. at better prices. Be very sure what you need before buying, there is a strict no return policy. They are the local pickup place for Borrowlenses.com.
