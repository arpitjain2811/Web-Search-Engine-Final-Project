It's not often an establishment gets five stars simply based off of the food. The location isn't great unless you work at a nearby business (this location is closed on Saturdays and Sundays because I presume 99% of their customer base comes from the big businesses nearby), the atmosphere itself is pretty boring and fast food-y, but OH GOD THE FOOD. There used to be a location much closer to my home, and I would find myself gorging on their food all the time, but it shut down, and now I happily drive 15 minutes each way to indulge in their delicious delicious chicken teriyaki wraps. Honestly, Samurai Sam's is the quickest (and cheapest) way to my heart. I don't care about the dull atmosphere or the inconvenient location. It's all about their wraps, and if you haven't tried one, stop what your doing and go! Go right this minute! And if it's a Saturday, go ahead and camp out until Monday. Because their food really is THAT good.

I have been here a lot but today is by far the worst. Management has changed they now charge 25 cents for an extra small sauce it is maybe the size of a tablespoon. Ridiculous! Also the meat and rice were extremely over cooked. No one that works there ever seems to know what is going on. So I am very unimpressed.

Went to the Deer Valley Center store....the worst! I ordered the Teriyaki beef and it was like chewing gum. All gristle and leather! NEVER AGAIN!
