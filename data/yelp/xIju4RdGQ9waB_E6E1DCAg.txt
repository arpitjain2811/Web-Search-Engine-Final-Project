The Pita Pit is smaller and somehow feels grungier than the just steps away Pita Factory. The prices are about the same and the pita ingredients are pretty similar too. This place definitely services the post bar crowd, especially those coming out of Caesar Martini's at the end of the night since it's right across the parking lot. I dunno, over all this place gets a big fat 'meh' from me.

Waterloo has so many pita choices. I don't know why people come to pita pit. The pitas are much smaller and more expensive than can be found elsewhere.

Not bad at all. Fresh pitas and toppings. Fast and friendly service. The chicken slovaki was great.
