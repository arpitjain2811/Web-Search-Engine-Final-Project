The only thing i hate about this apartment complex is how the office manages problems....they keep picking un qualified people to work on their gates and so every week they have someone in a tweaker vehicle come out and "fix " the gate instead of really fixing it...yesterday my boyfriend tried to pull out the back gate like normal and they have a 3inch bolt sticking off of the gate ....since the gate is being worked on by complete idiots it didnt open all the way up and my boyfriend caught his tire on the bolt and both the tire and the gate exploded and they are going to refuse to replace our tire....this is not our fault....if the office would quit being so cheap and have a real mechanic come fix the gates the right way they wouldnt be spending money every single week trying to fix them and they wouldnt have angry tenants posting bad reviews about them.....their gate ruined our tire and its our fault a 3inch bolt is sticking out of the gate .....so for now they barely deserve a one star.
