Tempe's long awaited and much anticipated skate park landed with a thud, i thought. location sucks, complaints are it's very technical, but it does have a concrete picnic table. the bowl ledges have real coping, so i'm not sure, but would imagine bikes are a no-go. full pads are REQUIRED, helmets, i'm not sure.

Lots of good lines here, nothing gnarly vert but plenty of lines to be had. Stick to the back half of the park if you're a tranny rider. Half bowl with shitty pool coping, small cradle, various hips, and a few extensions. Show up early morning or right before close. Little fuckers on razor scooters, rollerblades & skateboard camp kids plague this place. Suggestion : get blazed in car prior to entering park.
