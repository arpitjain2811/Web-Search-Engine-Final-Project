Typical QT. Fresh, cheap fuel, and tons of junk food.

Pretty standards as Quik Trips go.

For being one the only gas stations way out east here, it is your typical Quik Trip.  My only complaint is that they may have three or four people working at a time, but sometimes it is hard getting extra people to man the cash registers, unless a call for help goes out.
