Moving is tough.  When you need a place for your things to avoid overcrowding the house/apartment, this place provides roomy units at cheap prices.  There are promotions on their local website, and it's worth checking out.  We saved almost $40/month for three months with the promotions we found online.   Their location is great, and the security is good.  On top of that, it's clean.  I did, however, notice a bug problem, but being in the in desert, I find that quite normal.
