There are times when you need a fried chicken fix and over the years KFC is the place I turn to most often.  I always get original recipe and usually mac and cheese and cole slaw.   I have been to this location a few times.  Here the entire kitchen is open and they always seem disorganized.  In the dining room one of the trash containers was full to the point stuff was spilling out on to the floor.  One patron had to call her friend on her cell to ask at the counter for toilet paper.  I am sure I will go here again in the future because there are the closest KFC to work but I am glad I don't need a greasy fried chicken fix often these days.

Yes, I am yelping KFC. KFC gets a bad wrap. What's better than a good old fashioned bucket of original recipe chicken. Hit the spot for that hangover. Mmmmm good, grease dripping off the elbows! BOTTOM LINE: I'm good for 10 more years

Always on the slow side. I'd agree with Sott W. - they just don't seen to figure out how to make it work. They are busy, but not effective at all. It can take quite a while to get your food.

this might be the worst KFC in the world.

Avoid this store at all cost. Seriously, if you are dying of a horrible disease and the only known cure is eleven herbs and spices, *GO TO ANOTHER KFC*
