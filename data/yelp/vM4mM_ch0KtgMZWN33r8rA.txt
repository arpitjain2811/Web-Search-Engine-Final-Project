As you can see from the picture, these guys do old school Italian so i don't need to go into great detail about the look of the place. I'll get straight to the food, first trip I had one of the specials, Mezze Lune. Little pasta pockets stuffed with goats cheese in a creamy tomato sauce. Yummy. Second trip, we couldn't get a table. Waited for 20 minutes then left. Third trip I had Fieleto Diana, which was Â£18 but they gave me like half a cow served with a sweet onion sauce. This place is pricey, but you're paying for the extra effort they put into the food.
