At the Wickenburg Country Club, this is a great place to cool off after a round of golf and get a great sandwich and a ice cold beer or mixed drink.

I stopped by Ringo's with some co-workers when passing through Wickenburg.  It is located on the golf course, and has a great view from the outdoor seating area.  Service was friendly and although the menu was a bit limited, everyone was happy with their food.  I had the Asian chicken salad and it was very good.  Great flavor and fresh toppings.  The service was a bit slow, especially considering the place was empty; however our waitress was friendly.  Prices were very reasonable and they have a full bar if you need a cold beer on a hot day. Not bad at all for a casual lunch.

We were enticed with the fried fish and fried chicken for 4th of July dinner. What a joke...I may as well visited my friend at the nursing home and had dinner with him. Bland, obviously all pre-frozen and purchased by the 5 gallon bucket. Never going back...only saving grace was the server...delightful.
