Better than most Circle K's wasnt as dirty. Clean for a Circle K even though it dosent take much to be a clean Circle K.

Well not much to say about this Circle K....except considering that it is near the local car wash I go to and there is a Quik trip across the street and a Jiffy lube as well....this place seems pretty competitive. They seem to do good business...and at least the doors are not coming off the hinges....LOL. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!

Cool, chill, relaxed employees. Day and night. Always nicely greeted with a smile. Floors and counters seem pretty clean. Shelves always stocked and organized. Easy to find anything. Only 3 stars because one night I got a really bad hot dog. That makes me iffy bout their cleanliness. But it was 1 out of about 50 times I've gotten a hot dog there.
