VOX is a new clothing boutique that carries sizes 10+ which is a rare find in the area for us curvy girls! The owners are super friendly and make you feel right at home when you're shopping in their store.

Plus-size resale shop...thank goodness someone has finally created a place like this! Found some great shirts and cardigans. They even had some tall plus size jeans, which is super rare! Most of their clothes were in the larger range...like 16 and up, but it depends on what people bring in since they're a resale boutique. They sell shoes, belts, and clothing as well as some cool jewelry. So clean out that closet, girl!! You're sure to find something in there that you can trade up! ****Only open on Friday, Saturday and Sunday!*****

Love this place!  Super cute used and new clothing and accessories JUST for us curvy gals!  I found two great used dresses, and a brand new pair of heels that I adore.  Plus the owner and staff are super friendly and helpful.
