Doesn't get better than this as far as a shopping destination.   Vintage, primitives, wild west.....we were there browsing her interesting vignettes for almost an hour.

What a great place to have fun while shopping! All price ranges for different budgets and great custom furniture prices. Another benefit is having a professional interior designer work with you on your space so bring pictures and measurements and be prepared.for great recommendations

As an avid reader of Phoenix Mag, we'd seen Valerie's ads and made a point of visiting the showroom while in town. Beautiful store and well merchandised. However, the display of items were incredibly cluttered and it was a bit hard to take it all in. They're a bit over priced also. We didn't buy much, since we were out of town vacationers.
