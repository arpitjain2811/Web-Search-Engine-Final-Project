When you order a calzone you think you would get a calzone 40 minutes goes by I have to get a pizza because somebody didn't place the order correctly thanks for wasting time on my father daughter date

Slow service, bad pizza. The only good thing was they had 5 TVs and had the World Cup playing which we wanted to see. Other than that yuck. Pizza was greasy and undercooked.

Found Boka randomly one day, and has been one of my favorite pizza places since! The servers and friendly. I've met the owner a couple times and he is joyfully friendly as well! The Pizza is delicious and there are many choices! There is a little wait because they cook in a brick in an oven but it's well worth the wait! Also, they have great prices on beer! So grab a beer while you wait for your pizza to cook and hang out! Love this place!
