Brookstone is the Sharper Image's older and more laid back cousin.  Yea, it's got a similar feeling, but it's more focused on keeping you relaxed and healthy than on funky electronic toys.  The massaging chairs, pads and other devices are enough motivation to stop in alone.  And if you're with a partner who's less interested than shopping, it's a great place for them to just hang out too!  (Trust me - this works.)

We have all been either dragged to the mall, or been the one who has dragged someone with them. Well if you find yourself being dragged to PV Mall make an escape to the Brookstone store if you can.  This store has everything you need to walk out feeling amazing. Massage chairs and tools of every kind, which are out and ready to be tested by you! I think the main idea of this store is items which will make you life more tolerable. Don't pay $ 2.00 for someone to massage you in the mall. Trust me just come here!

I went in to look for a protector sleeve for my 17" laptop, but they only carry for Macbooks. Oh well, I won't get any support here. But, in all honesty, the guys that work there are as helpful as they can be. Very friendly. Stop in for a visit...especially if you're waiting for your sisters while shopping for shoes lol
