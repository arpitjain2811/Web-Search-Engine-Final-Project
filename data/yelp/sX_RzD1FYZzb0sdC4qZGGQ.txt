Once upon a time, this was the only Del Taco that was near my house.  I would drive 10+ minutes out of my way to stop here....ahh the college years were always good times.  Now, I only stop here when I'm in the area and need to find a quick bite to satisfy my growling stomach.  It can get pretty crowded during the lunch rush, so I try to avoid it if possible. Their speed, accuracy, and quality is about par with other Del Taco restaurants.  I enjoy the Big Fat Chicken Tacos and Veggie Works Burritos. Will I return?  Sure.

I like Del Taco in general, but I won't be going back to this location. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with no sauce, but they gave me one with sauce. The tortilla was hard and it looked like it had been sitting for awhile. I also had to wait for them to come back to the window for part of my order that they forgot.
