Went in for pizza and cheesy bread. Waited over 30 minutes for my food and the whole time no one told me what was going on. When I finally got.my food the pizza wasn't fresh and they never apologized for the wait or thanked me.

Slow service. Had to wait for hit and ready. No communication. Very slow. Very very sad.

For what you pay for (value $5), and general speed of service, Little Caesars is a good option.  I went in on Saturday about 5pm and it was ready without ordering.  At times in the past I've had to wait 5 minutes tops. I generally get one for for the kids, at times I'll indulge too.  Average tasting, some better, some worse.

It's always a handy option when you're not up to cooking for the tribe. Their customer service is fast and polite. The product is what it is, not the best but better than a stick in the eye when your in a pinch.

Ya'll already know how I feel about Lil Ceas.

The price is good for what you get and for the convenience (if it's ready). It's not anything to write home about but it's decent for $5. When the pizza is ready, it's nice to just come in and have it already done but I find the problem is at peak times, like dinner, the pizzas aren't ready. Umm...ok? I come at dinner time and it's a 15-20 min wait for a "hot and ready" pizza. I understand it's a busy time but shouldn't you take that into account and forecast how many you'll need when you are making pizzas for the peaks? Otherwise, stop calling it hot and ready when it's not! Kind of defeats the purpose of me coming to little Caesars versus a competitor. It's not like I pick this place over other pizza joints because it tastes better...
