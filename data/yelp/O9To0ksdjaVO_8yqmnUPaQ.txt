A cute, colorful little coffee shop catering to the indie and punk set.  A punky clothing store/head shop shares the second floor landing next to the cafe.

It was the best coffeeshop in all of Madison. And then it closed (was it 2003 or 2004?) So, so sad.

It was! THE BEST!!!!! Starbucks moved in and State St. hit its maximum capacity for cafes, and Assisi was on the second floor, tucked away - so despite its loyal regulars, it shut down since it couldn't pick up the to-go traffic. That's the story of its end.  Its twenty-year history, with two sets of owners and its reincarnation as a collective, is another story.
