All Subway foods probably taste the same- the main difference is service. Some Subways are incredibly slow, some places are dirty, etc.  What got me at this one was that the person making the sandwich put the lid for one of the food troughs on top of the plastic that separates the food from the customer, and it slid off and landed on the floor where customers walk in.  On my way out I picked it up and handed it to the person and she PUT IT RIGHT ON THE FOOD!  I will not be returning to this Subway.

I went on May 23 at 3 pm and the guy working was rude and nasty, never again will I visit this location. He gave me an attitude. All I wanted was a cookie so I stood by the cookies: the guy gave me a attitude, "you know the line starts here" and I was the only customer in there.
