I took MAP 9, I'm in MAP 12 and I have a personal coach from SE5.  They've definitely helped me with my results! Thanks Denise, Patricia and all the coaches!

The coaches of SE5 operate from care, compassion and the desire to move you in the direction of your dreams.   If you want to take serious steps towards achieving your dreams and goals, I highly recommend taking the MAP class - it stands for Massive Action Program!  MAP helped me turn a 1-year goal into reality within 60 days! Thanks Patricia and Denise!  You rock!

If you want to increase your business, take the MAP class.  I have taken it twice MAP 2 and MAP 8 each time I take it my business goes through the roof!  I also had a contribution goal which was blown out of the water!  I am excited to take if for the 3rd time this spring! The coaches provide unconditional support and lead by example. The coaches are able to work with anyone no matter what level of goal setting you are on. If this is the first time you are setting goals and need extra help they are able to provide, or if you are someone who has many years of experience working on yourself, they can keep you accountable and challenge you in a way you have may never experienced.
