Jason and his staff are top notch! He is my saving grace for my back which with his good hands, keeps me working and living here in Scottsdale Arizona!

Front desk staff is friendly and easy to talk to.  Jason is concerned about your well being and wants to see you make progress!   Appointments are easy to make, and typically, I just drop in and get in right away!

I love this practice.  I pinched a nerve in my lower back and they fixed me right up. Dr Kim even came in on a Saturday when they were closed when I had gotten hurt.  Anca at the front is so nice, I always enjoy chatting with her. I wouldn't go anywhere but here! I now see Dr. Jason and he is great.  I have been seeing him throughout my pregnancy and has really helped my back pain.  I recommend Brother's to everyone I know.

I'm still seeing Jason about 4 times a year. His knowledge of my spinal issues lets me know that when I have a problem he knows how to correct it. I moved a couple years ago out of the Scottsdale area and attempted to find someone that might be able to make the adjustments I need, but all they wanted to do was up-sell me in to treatments I just don't need. So, I continue to make the long drive up North to see Jason. And it's totally worth it!
