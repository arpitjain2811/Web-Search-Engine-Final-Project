The woman that runs this place is super helpful and knowledgeable. She fixed problems with a title that even the employees at the DMV in Scottsdale couldn't figure out. It's a small shop so sometimes there's a wait, but it's way faster than the DMV with better hours.

Evidently you need a smog check that is less than 4 months old.  The lady at the counter gave me a place to run to (like 5 miles away), and I was back at AZ Quick Title & Registration within 30 min receiving my license plates!  Simple!  Much easier than the DMV...

This place makes is so easy for a vehicle renewal. And it was only a $16 convenience charge added to the total.   I was seriously in and out in less then 5 minutes. Highly recommend this vs going to the DMV and waiting in line.
