Great place. My son and I get our hair cut by Jeff and my wife and daughter use Karen. I can't imagine going anywhere else. The place is clean and the atmosphere is friendly. I have and would recommend them to anyone. VIP treatment all the way.

Great salon in Las Vegas! I love that they have a barber section as well as a full salon section. Being able to get your nails done AND hair done in one trip is awesome!! Lots of parking, great selection of hair products to keep my tresses tamed between appointments. All of that mixed with some talented professionals who arnt pretentious , makes this this my go to spot. I highly reccomend it if your looking for a down to earth place in Vegas.
