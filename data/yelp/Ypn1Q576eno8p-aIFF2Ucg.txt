I've never really had a pest control company that I was impressed by. Titan is great. Request Robert if he's available. Very friendly and goes above and beyond when he sprays.

So I have used a number of comanies, gone back and forth trying to find the best pest control that works. I hate scorpions and I don't want them in my house!. I have tried everything to doing it myself with stuff from the store, to all natural pest companies that make my house smell wonderful but wasn't great at getting the bugs. I have ended up coming back to titan everytime. So far so good. With their attic dusting, I have probably only had 1-2 (knock on wood) scorpions during the summers that's it!. The workers are hit an dmiss; some are great and some are not so friendly, however the prices are completly reasonable .

If you want to lose a pet, this is the place to call.  The technician that serviced our home had only been with the company a week and had already received a complaint of having lost a pet of one if their customers.  The same technician "managed" to lose our pet as well (albeit accidentally on purpose) and only after a great deal of tribulation was she miraculously found in a distant neighbors yard.  Long story short,I deeply question their hiring and background checks of employees and feel that the security of my home and that of my family has been compromised for having chosen Titan for service
