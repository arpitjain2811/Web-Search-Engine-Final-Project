Liz at Nutzy Mutz and Crazy Catz is amazing! She helped me choose a healthy food for my overweight cat and helped me get my little backyard chicken coop ready to go. She also delivers! Yay for not having to carry 50# bags of food around!!

I am so grateful that these folks have a store on the West Side (conveniently located right next door to my coffee shop and gym!) because I wouldn't go anywhere else for my cat's and dog's food. Organic food of every variety and the best collars, leashes, toys, treats, and staff anybody could ask for! Now if only they would open a grooming shop so I don't have to go to PetSmart anymore...

So impressed by there outstanding customer service. I am a fairly new dog owner just got another puppy. Took both to the store on Midvale. She answered all my question. I was worry my dogs would not like the food I brought. Could not believe it she said they have sample packs.  Foods even made in Wisconsin.  Felt so at home glad I went.
