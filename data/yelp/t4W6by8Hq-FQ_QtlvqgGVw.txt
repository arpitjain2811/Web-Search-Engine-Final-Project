My son and I went in on his birthday and the owners kid was working.  He was very friendly got us signed up quickly and because it was my sons birthday he let him have an extra 10 minutes or so and even gave him some pointers.  We enjoyed the place, prices are good, facility is clean and nice!

I brought my 6 year old niece here for the batting cages. They pitching machines go as low as 35 mph and she batted for 30 min ($20). She had a blast. The employee setting everything up for us was attentive and kept coming by to make sure we were okay.  The front desk woman was also extremely kind. She said kids of all ages go there and they have camps for the summer. My niece had a blast and we will definitely be coming back.
