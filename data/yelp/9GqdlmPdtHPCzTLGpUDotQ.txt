Wonderful staff, Rosy is a pleasure to encounter and my family has always received quality service from her Pharmacy. A friendlier, more personal pharmacy experience that keeps us coming back.

My family swithced to Rosy's over a year ago and we have never had a better experience with a Pharmacy. Rosy and her staff are wonderful! I would encourage anyone who lives close enough to experience what real customer service feels like.
