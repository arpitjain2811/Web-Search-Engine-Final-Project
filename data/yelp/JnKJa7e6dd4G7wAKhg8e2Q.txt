Amazing arrangements !!!!   The care and detail put into the flowers is remarkable and creative.  I would highly recommend this flower shop to all my family and friends.  I stopped by the store to personally thank the owner and was pleasantly surprised by the unique and spectacular gifts they have in stock.  Thank you !!!!!

I visited this unique little flower shop recently and was so impressed. The minute I walked in the door I could tell this was my kind of flower shop. It was clean, welcoming and the staff was so friendly and helpful. This flower shop not only has great floral arrangements, it has really unique items for a special events, decorating or for gift giving!  I'll be back time and time again!

I've used this florist for the last few years because the flowers are of good quality.  Unfortunately, they have a problem counting.  Last year I ordered 2 dozen roses for delivery and my wife received only 1 dozen.  They refunded the difference so I decided to try them again this year.  Well, I was disappointed again.  They delivered 23 roses.  I just can't use them any more.
