I was in Las Vegas for a short vacation and decided to stop into this shop to get a couple new charms for my Pandora bracelet.  The first time I went in, it was a madhouse.  Absolute insanity.  So, I went back a second time a day later.  I found the store empty.  I was met by the friendliest woman and she helped me find everything I was looking for.   I found six charms that I love and the service was impeccable.  Cannot say enough that I recommend this store and its service.

This is just like any other Pandora Jewelry shop. The only difference is that they offer the lucky dice. It is actually a charm that was originally retired, however now it can only be picked up in Vegas.  I had to pick up two - one for me and one for my mom - that way we can always remember our time in Vegas Baby!

Super friendly shop, nice workers. I got the lucky dice. I asked if the shop had anything exclusive to LV and they directed me to some new (boring) winter stuff and the dice. I paid with a card, no hassle there. It's a nice little treat for yourself while you're away on vacation. A lot of what's in this mall is waaaaaay too expensive (a Chanel scarf, 18"x18" = $385) but this is pretty accessible to most Americans.

This location is just as nice as the other store located in Honolulu.  I didn't buy anything at this one since our State tax is cheaper back home but such a magical charm store that's sure to please any collector!

On Wednesday I went to the Pandora at Fashion Show Mall to buy the dice. The bracelet was a recent BD gift. The very helpful sales woman showed me the newest charm....a silver dangle with the Welcome to Vegas sign!!!  So I bought both!!  She also rearranged my charms to showcase the dice. Very happy with charms and service
