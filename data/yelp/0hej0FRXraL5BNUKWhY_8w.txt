Was on my way to a friend's house and stopped for a quick bite to eat.  Ordered: Volcano Burrito - $2.99 7 Layer Burrito - $2.09 Double Decker Taco Supreme - $1.89 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4UmjnX46qbhV6-D5W89IOQ?select=SmsWfXhrU4AJl6D4nJu6bw They were fast, accurate, and the food was decent.  It's a Taco Bell, what would you expect? Return Factor - 15%

This used to be a good place to go in a pinch for a quick lunch.  But the service has really gone down hill. If you go through the drive thru .. DO NOT EXPECT to get packets of sauce even when you ask for them.  Also don't expect your drink occasionally because they think they gave it to you. The food is good..  But the service really has taken a turn for the worse here. I hope they get it together soon.

It's Taco Bell. Fast food, Americanized Mexican food. It's cheap and quick. We seem to stop here after a late night at the bar and suddenly realize we're hungry and have nothing in the frig. Taco's, Mexican Pizza, Nachos, or chicken Chalupas are usually what I get; my husband seems to like their burritos. Don't expect anything hot or spicy even with the sauce packets.

We had a wonderful experience this evening. Our drive thru window attendant Abby was very friendly and professional.

Normally a Taco Bell is a Taco Bell. However this is not the case here as the people always go way beyond what you would expect. The restaurant is always super clean. The people working there are always very polite, friendly, and have a respectable appearance. The food is also always great; I've never had a bad meal there. Basically the  employees take pride in their work there and it shows.
