I absolutely love this barn! The facilities are nice and well taken care of, and the horses are well cared for. I have been boarding my horse here for a while and could not be happier! The people are nice and the trainers are great. I'm so glad I found this place:)

Hunter's Edge is top notch.  Great people and a family-friendly, no drama environment!  The well-being of the horses always comes first in all of my observations and the horses here receive top notch care.  It is a safe and non-judgemental place to learn, equally conducive to both children, junior, and adult riders.  It is also a competitive show barn with a team of dedicated riders who compete regularly.  Judge for yourself!  Take a tour, meet the riders, and get to know the staff.
