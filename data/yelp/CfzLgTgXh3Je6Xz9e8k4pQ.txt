The food at Bombay is always fresh and has wonderful flavor.  It's nice to have a place that you can get a healty lunch at in a short amount of time.

The website states you can call in to order food. Yet no one has answered the phone for 45 min during what would be a restaurants busy time. I understand I may have to call back if the phone is not answered the first or even second time due to it being busy.  I have never eaten here and was looking forward to trying it out, but now I will never know. That is just bad business.
