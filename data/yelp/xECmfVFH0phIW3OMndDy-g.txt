Now that Border's has closed they are really the only game in town.  I buy most of my books online at Amazon but come here to browse and then buy my travel guides.

I can't find a single power outlet anywhere! None in the cafe! I came here to do work but need a power source to charge my laptop and there are none! This is horribly disappointing

I love this store location. It is so big and love how it is two stories. The employees are very nice and super helpful! I also love how they have a Starbucks inside. This store overall is huge and takes a while just to see everything inside! I definitely prefer coming to this location than other ones around me!
