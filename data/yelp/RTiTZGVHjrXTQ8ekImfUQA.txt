Our pizza was totally raw!  Completely disgusting and totally un-edible.  I would give 0 stars if I could.

You know what you're going to get: delivery/take-out pizza. I'm not expecting gourmet anything and I'm not disappointed. They're fast, efficient and consistent. I usually order online and pick it up -- the people behind the counter are always pretty friendly.

Ordered a large pizza with extra cheese for take out last night.  The pizza was smaller than most large sized pizzas. The crust was like cardboard and there was very little cheese. $15.00 for a very lousy pizza.
