When I'm craving Chinese food in Las Vegas, I always stroll down to the Buffet Orient. Although their selection isn't comparable to the massive 4 Star Hotel neighbors down the block, their Chinese food is one of the best I have tasted so far in the city. If you're thinking about going to grab fast food, think again... For under $6 per person, it'll get you salads, entrees and desserts. Or, you can also just load your plate with french fries.

I'd suggest you call first. This place seems to be out of business ... replaced with a mexican restaurant.
