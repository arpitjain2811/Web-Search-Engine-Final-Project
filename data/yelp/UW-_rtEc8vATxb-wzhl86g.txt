I stopped by my local branch because of a problem with my account. I had to wait over a half hour to speak to someone. Other people were waiting, and one of them just got up and left because he was tired of waiting. I'm not a fan of this bank in general and closed my account, so I won't have to deal with them again.

It's Bank of America... I like this one over the Bell and Grand  Ave. location.  They are helpful, the drive thru is sometimes slow, but it's not their fault that people use the drive thru lane without knowing or having their transaction ready.

B of A sticks! They nickel and dime you for everything. Their customer service stinks too. I will never go there again!
