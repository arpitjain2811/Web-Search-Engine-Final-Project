Western Delights is such a cute store! My aunt and I went in there to check out there jewelry and there were so many gorgeous necklaces, bracelets, earrings and antique jewels there. I ended up buying a pair of earrings with blue stones and I love them. This store supports local artists, has reasonable prices, and the owner is super friendly and helpful. My aunt and I tried on a bunch of different pieces and the lady at the store knew so much about each one. I definitely recommend checking out this place the next time you're in the Scottsdale area and looking for jewelry from local artists.

Love this store! It's a wonderful place to find a unique affordable gift. The owner is super friendly and knowledgable. It seems as though there is a story or history associated with every item in the store.  I especially love the jewelry here. I picked up a gorgeous pendant made by Navajo artists. I also have my eye on silver earrings and a few other things in the store. I will definitely shop here again and I plan to take all visiting family and friends too!
