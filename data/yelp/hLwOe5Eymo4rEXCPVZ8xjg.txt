Excellent service, I will use every time.  My phone would no longer charge, I stopped in at 10:30am and they were able to fix it by 10:45am. It was a broken port, the entire phone had to be taken apart however he was quick and polite.  The cost for repair was way below my expectations. Two thumbs up.

dropped off my iPad 2 to replace the glass screen digitizer. great prices for all devices, not just iPads. these guys did a great job and it was ready in 1 day. I would recommend this place for all glass replacements. my iPad looks brand new like the day I bought it.

My iPhone was smashed up real bad. I brought it here and now it's back to perfect, and for much cheaper than I could find anywhere else. The repair was done in thirty minutes while I waited in an chilled waiting room with a tv, comfy couch, and Internet access. A 3 month warranty was included for free as well. This is my first review because up until now, I just used yelp to look up places. I'm super happy with the work so I wanted to write a proper review.
