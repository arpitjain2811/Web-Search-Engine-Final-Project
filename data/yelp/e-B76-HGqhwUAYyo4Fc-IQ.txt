Best Mexican food in the Phoenix area.  I've been going there for, what, like 10 years?  Still perfect.  Still awesome. I got two carne asada tacos and the carne asada burrito.  The meat is so good.  The burrito has the right mix of meat, beans, cilantro, and seasonings. We'll go back for at least 10 more years!

We got carne asada burritos.  My first impression was 4.5 stars because of not many salsa options, but by the end of the burrito I realized it wasn't necessry. The meat has a ton of flavor and the tortillas are amazing. The staff  is also very friendly. I'll definitely be back any time I'm in the area.
