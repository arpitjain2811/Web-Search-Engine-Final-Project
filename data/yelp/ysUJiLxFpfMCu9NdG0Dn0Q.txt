Well what can you really say, it's Taco Bell. My family rarely eat fast food, but once in awhile it always hits the spot. Unfortunately the service in the drive-thru deliberately tries to screw over the customer. Grouchy lady (not that I expect much anyway) with star tattoos on her neck ruined the experience. I asked for extra mild sauce, she repeated the request and then when we got home we had one packet for a family of four. Completely deliberate. If she's doing that imagine what she's doing to the store owner. Lady, if you don't like your job, quit! Let someone else get hired that wants to work.

Food is decent, but the service is SOOOO slow.  This has got to be the slowest Taco Bell i've ever been in, and that is saying a lot!   I am obsessed with the Grillers, particularly the chipotle chicken w/ added nacho cheese. . Mmm... now I'm hungry.

I was in the drive thru about 10 minutes before they closed and the girl came over the speaker and said they were out of food and closed......ok
