Does one have to give 1 star?  This is the worst Macdonalds in the Valley. Avoid it if you can.  Worst management & staff imaginable and all follows from that.

Yeah, yeah, I know, two McDonalds in one week??  There's something wrong with this picture.  But this one wasn't my fault.  My daughter was interviewing a potential child care person and they met there.  She had asked me to come along and give a second opinion.  Which was a thumbs down.   One reason for picking McDonalds was because of the play area so my two year old grandson would have something to do since he was coming, too.  Oh, and guess who had to climb up the indoor slide to talk him down when he went too high, lost sight of me, got scared, and started crying.  TWICE.  You got it.  But he loved it and I got my exercise in for the evening chasing him all over the place and keeping him out of the kitchen.  His favorite place to head for in restaurants these days.  And I got a mint hot chocolate.  Fancy name is Mocha Mint or something. Oh, and firsties on reviewing the place.

I'm only giving one star because I have to. They don't have ice cream seriously? What kind of mcdonalds doesn't have that. We won't be back..
