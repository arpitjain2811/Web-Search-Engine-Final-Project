The owner is friendly, helpful, and kind. This is a Mom and Pop place, and not all glitchy and glitzy like the big corporate chain stores. I enjoyed my visit here, and bought my birdy a toy that she loves at a price a bit cheaper than the corporate stores sell it for.

This shop sells electronics and birds. It is woefully depressing in there. I feel sorry for the birds. The guy needs to not be in the bird business. If you want to see a great bird shop in he area go to Tropic Zone.

This is a great place. The owner is super friendly. The birds are amazing. He boarded for me and my bird came back in a great mood!

The owner is very kind and knowledgeable.  The feed is far better than what you would find at a large retail store.  You can tell the birds are well cared for.  A much better option than having someone that knows nothing about birds watching my baby.  :)
