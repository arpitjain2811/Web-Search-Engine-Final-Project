Incredibly clean, professional, and courteous.  And best of all FREE WIFI.  Easy to browse the web or watch movie on Netflix on your tablet as you donate.  Piece of cake.

Professional, courteous, and clean. Mia was my nurse and she was great. Everyone should give blood and help save a life. See you in January!
