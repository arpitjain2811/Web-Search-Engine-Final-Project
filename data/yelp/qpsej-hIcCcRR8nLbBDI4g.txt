I love this place! Employees are always friendly and helpful, and the place is always clean and shiny despite all the traffic it gets. I pick up sandwiches on my way to work sometimes that make my coworkers jealous! Great place and great peeps! Thumbs up!

I know QuickTrip is a convenience store, but I would swear they are hiring Harvard Grads as the counter help.  Always very very professional and courteous.  This store is immaculate and the product selection is very nice.  Their gas prices are usually the lowest in the neighborhood and are only occasionally edged out by Costco.

Full trash bins, over charged for free drink with sandwich purchase, unfriendly man working today.   This is not what I am used to for a QT.
