I've been to Dr. Waring now twice.  He is an outstanding physician!  The Doctor and his staff are very professional and nice.  I have high anxiety every time I go to Dentists and Doctors and these people make me feel very comfortable.  His office and facilities are very nice and modern.

For over 20 years I have been a patient of Dr Waring.  He's outstanding as a periodontist, plus he takes great pride in his work.  I go there four times a year for teeth cleaning and find the entire staff great to work with.   Pat Brock

I found Dr. Waring not particularly attentive to my needs as a patient.
