I Have been going  to this clinic for seven years now and cannot say enough about the people and treatment I have been given.  I suffer from lower back pain and the doctors here know exactly what I need every time they see me.   They do not run the same adjustment every time but tailor adjustment for my needs.  I also get my nutritional supplements here and trust their opinion on this as well.
