Quite the service with a smile. They seemed happy and welcoming once I came in and overall I am glad I gave them a chance. I usually make the trip to GhetroCenter because they have the best Barbers in the greater phoenix area in my opinion. Well this was very close to the cut quality I would get from there. He did exactly what I wanted, then cleaned my line up with a straight razor. Good casual conversation and it ended with a 2 minute electronic massage. Great place to go if you live in Goodyear (17 dollar cut)

They are always friendly when you go in and always have something good to watch on TV. I've been going there off & on for a couple of years and appreciate their service. Their cuts are great, conversations are good and probably the most relaxing atmosphere of all the barbers I've been to in the area!

Nice people; Inconsistent haircuts I like the shop and the people.  It can be a little busy, so you know they are doing something well.  Prices are reasonable and it's a chance to watch some sports or an action flick while you get a trim. Only knock is that I get a different haircut each time.  Same instructions, but depending on the person and the day, I can come out looking quite a bit different.

"Friendly service, great cuts, hot towel shave! Best barber I've been to on the West side. Don't waste your $ at the chain barbers."

My 19-y.o. son Michael had never been to a barber shop.  He was very impressed with the quality of service and they went above and beyond to make sure the haircut looked good. The hot towel and back/shoulder massage topped off the haircut -- he was treated to a "real" guy experience.  We will be back!!

Best barber shop I have ever been to.  Massage and hot towel?  Are you kidding me?  They fade so clean and tight, the massage and hot towel are only the icing on the cake.  I was loyal to the same barber for over 5 years when I decided to give these guys a shot.  I never went back.

Always satisfied when I walk out! I'm a barber so it feels nice to be on the chair and trust me when I say, they know what they're doing!

Best haircut for men in the west valley. I have been coming here for over a year now and have never been upset with any part of it. They are true barbers and always give a great haircut and wrap it up with a strait razor shave and short shoulder massage. It is $17 for a cut but we'll worth it if you take pride in your appearance.
