One of the better nicely maintained community center with a lot of sports league.

Great facility to play basketball/other court sports. It's relatively new, and it's never crowded. And for a $5 membership, you get unlimited access!  They also have badminton from 4-6pm on Saturdays!

This is a great family park ands makes me wish I lived in the area. I visited for the SRP Shade Tree program and spent some time at the playground with my 4 year old.  He loved the playground and watching the skateboarders. The water area looked fun too but was obviously closed for the season.  Tons of grassy areas for a family get together.

The staff is friendly and the facilities are clean and bright. My son LOVES the Itty Bitty Sports class. Don't know what we'd do without this great facility!
