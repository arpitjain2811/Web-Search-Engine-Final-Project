When they have deals there not too bad, they send you a lot of coupons for formula and one of the only places that has a large variety.. I've tried kohls, Burlington, target ect. But all there selections were very small. Macy's isn't bad either and they also sell motherhood stuff...

The clerk was extremely helpful and, because she was preggers too, truly did understand my needs. She was very personable and knowledgeable.

I really like the new store, they redid it and it's much nicer. Not a very big selection of plus sized maternity, which is hard when you're inbetween their sizes. The clerk was very friendly and helpful which made a difference. I shop with them online quite a bit and they do seem to have good sales.
