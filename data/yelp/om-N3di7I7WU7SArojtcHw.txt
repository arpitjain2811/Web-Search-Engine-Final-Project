I guess La Fortuna means The Fortune in Italian? Everything in this place seemed like it cost a fortune, so I guess that's appropriate. Showcasing $600+ shiny plastic looking bags in the window, and $400 bathing suit cover ups on the walls...this place was definitely not where I was spending my money. It connects to the little hotel toiletries shop, and also sells super fancy soaps and lotions. Perk on the cute Westie soap that I'd buy but never use. The salesgals were quite friendly, and showed us prices on anything we asked to see....my friend was tempted to come home with one of the cuter bag styles in a pinkish tan leather, some brand that I had never heard of, but it had to be good for $600 right?? Nah...we passed. $300 for a hat to shade your face from the sun in a soft terry cloth just seems SO wrong.

Everything is expensive, but i love this place. Love the sales people as well as the fact that they have most of what you'll need when you stay at the Palazzo.
