Someone that understands business. I just went in to get a new battery. I didn't have any cash on me so he told me to come back whenever and pay him. I don't often go to watch repair shops, but if I ever need to or someone asks I will certainly send my business to DeChance. I will also be going back tomorrow to pay him.

I had a broken watch band and was looking for a nearby repair place. Doug was great, he replaced the missing pin, tightened up the fit, all while I waited and for a whopping $5. When the watch itself needs repairing, I would not hesitate to go back here.

Doug has been maintaining my two Rolex watches for over a decade. He is honest, and technically superb. A  pleasure to work with!

Took in two of my watches for new batteries and a band repair. Extremely friendly and prompt service. Very low prices.

Doug did a great job on my Tag. It took longer then expected but was not his fault. Fixed it and polished it like new. I highly recomend him.
