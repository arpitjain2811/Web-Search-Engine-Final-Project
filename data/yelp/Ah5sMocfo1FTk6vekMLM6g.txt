We are so happy to have a German restaurant so close to home now. Our first visit was during their first week after opening. The waiter was very friendly and helped offer suggestions from the menu. They have German beer and wine selections available that both of us enjoyed. My wife ordered the schnitzel with mushroom sauce and I ordered the sauerbraten. Both were prepared quickly and we enjoyed every bite. This will definitely be a do-over for us so we can try more of the menu.

Great German food here. Nice selection of beers. The waiter was very informative and answered all of our questions. We tried the Vienna Style Schnitzel and the Pretzel Dumplings with Mushroom Sauce. Both were delicious! We especially enjoyed the fried potatoes with the schnitzel. The apple strudel was great for dessert. One suggestion is to have suggested beer pairings with the entrees.

I love this place! I've been here three times during lunch. They give you just the right amount of portions. I've tried the Brat, schnitzel and curry wurst and I loved them. I also want to take they're pot of soup home with me because it takes so great:!!!
