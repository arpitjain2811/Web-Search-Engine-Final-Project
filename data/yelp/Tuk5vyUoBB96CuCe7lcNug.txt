Great service and food.

I recently had my wedding here this past weekend, the venue was nice, the food was good. However, I am very disappointed in the wedding planner nadine, she was very rude to all of our guest.  She was rushing everybody and running on her own time instead of ours, and stressing everyone out including me, the bride!

Have your wedding here!  Nadine is awesome, the food is awesome, and the venue is beautiful. You get a lot of bang for your buck too. We just had our wedding there and would do it again in a heartbeat.
