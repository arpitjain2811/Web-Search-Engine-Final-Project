Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the King's horses, And all the King's men Couldn't put Humpty together again.....but the therapists at Matt Smith Physical Therapy could. Seriously, if you need physical therapy or occupational therapy, this is the place to go.

This was the worse experience that I've ever had at a physical therapy clinic. The facility was a ZOO, everyone was running around & very disorganized. I had 4 sessions of physical therapy at this facility & was treated most of the time by the Technicians. The Technicians were nice, but when I go to physical therapy, I expect to be treated by physical therapist. I've had many sessions of physical therapy in the past due to various injuries throughout my life & would not recommend Matt Smith to anyone. I also spoke to several patients at the facility & not one of them was happy with the services that they were getting.

The people at Matt Smith are GREAT! I couldn't possibly acknowledge all that they have done for me or compliment them enough on their great attitudes their friendly nature and ultimately their caring approach to helping you get back to a "normal" life with usual activities. Their facility is clean and well kept, and so is the equipment. The therapists are knowledgable and consistent in their treatment.
