I totally love this location of Carl's Jr.  The food is great, the service is excellent and they are always very nice.  I brought some friends from out of town who hadn't had Carl's Jr. before and they loved it too!

Very disappointed! I went once and got the spicy chicken sandwitches witch are my all time favorites there and I got sick and was in the bathroom. I didn't believe it was them so I went back two weeks later got my same and what do you know same thing happened this time to me and my boyfriend!!! I say watch out here cause something isn't right witch is a total bummer:(

Carl's Jr is my favorite fast food place. The chicken Club is my favorite. The Famous Star is great when Ihave a yearning for red meat. HOWEVER...how can it be that they've been out of Diet Coke for four days now????!!!! You might as well be out of buns as far as I'm concerned. I am seriously considering finding another location or another chain. I got to wait in line for four others to get their orders when I was getting nothing since they didn't have my drink. The Coke/Pepsi thing is a deal breaker with me and I was glad CJ went the Coke route but this is ridiculous!
