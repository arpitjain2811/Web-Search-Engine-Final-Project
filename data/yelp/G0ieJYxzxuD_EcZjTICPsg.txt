As good as it gets for a Taco Hell... The cashier, Lani, who served us even knew how to do basic math in her head!!!   It's really sad when you are impressed that a cashier can do this at a fast food place, but good for Lani for not following the register and giving my friend $206,000 when the register created an error for itself. :)  She didn't even pull out a calculator. :) But that would have been a great win on the way to Vegas. Lani was friendly and took control of it all with a smile. :)  It was great... she said, "It's fast food, not rocket science".  I had to die laughing when I heard that one. :) Bathroom was clean and everything was well stocked.
