so I ordered as usual not allot of waiting from order to window... I get to the window and the employee asks me my order... slightly annoyed I repeat it and he sass..." Your Order Got Deleted"... so I pay the $7.31.. Thinking the entire time.... (being a Ronald McDonald's graduated of 83') Errors like this is an "Automatic Free Meal".. Will have to email Corp office on my "Deleted Order"
