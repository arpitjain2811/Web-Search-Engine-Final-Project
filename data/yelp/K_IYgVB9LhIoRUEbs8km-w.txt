We love this place. We have been through the drive-thu so many times.  We always get the veggie burro, fries, and the taco combo. The burro is giant; filled with beans, rice, guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions.  They have crinkle fries. We love Erikbertos.

This place is way better then Filibertos because you don't wind up with the horrible bathroom problems. They are also cheaper, carne asada fries here are like $5 as opposed to $7 for the same amount.  They also have guacamole chips which I have not been able to find anywhere else and I have a serious addiction to them. There would be a picture but I eat them way too fast for that to happen!  The ground beef tacos are also super yummy!

Got the order wrong, one item and tried to over charge me!  No one in the drive thru at all. Went to filibertoes down the street at Signal Butte and 6 cars in line!  Hope the OWNER can get things together. Disappointing to say the least.
