We started using PH Balance last year after we had our pool and pool area redone (we wanted to make sure we took care of our investment!). What I like best besides having a sparkling clean pool- is that you deal with Shain directly- it's not often that you find this kind of customer service!!

Used this business twice once for a variable speed pump install and second time was for a cartridge system  filter install and both times I was well pleased. The prices were reasonable and  i would defiantly do business again

Shain is amazing. He makes sure my pool is taken care of, is here when he says he will be here. He replaces what needs replacing but doesn't try to replace things that don't in order to make extra money. He treats his customers how he would like to be treated and it shows.

We needed somebody to do our Pool maintenance while we were out of town. I called around and talked to several Pool maintenance companies. Shain from pH Balanced Pools stood out with his professionalism and candor. Shain is prompt with his communications and courteous. Plus he is very knowledgeable about matters related to pool chemistry and maintenance. Finally, he tells it like it is and is willing to work with his customers to meet individual service levels and needs. We were lucky to connect with pH Balanced pools and  feel confident out pool is in safe hands with Shain. Thanks Shain!
