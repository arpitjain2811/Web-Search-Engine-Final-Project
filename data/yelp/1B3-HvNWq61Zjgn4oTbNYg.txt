I don't think I could feel complete without a pet in our family.!!! We have two pups and a cat, so I frequent PetSmart quite often. They have the best selection of dog treats, we like to use the dental sticks which helps control tartar and helps with stinky breath! They work! Plus the boys really love them. As for Klaus our cat she loves the grass they sell there. Service is always friendly and the return policy rocks! I purchased two Kong balls and the boys fought over them constantly, I had to return them - they were great! No problem, I received store credit, but I didn't mind. This PetSmart also has a Banfield Pet Hospital, Pet Hotel , Grooming and Doggie Day Care. It's a nice to have sooooo many options  close to home.

Helpful employees, healthy fish, and great prices. Great news for those of us out in the sticks!

Good selection on pet products. Fish seem to live well. Dog treats are more expensive then Wal-Mart. The dog day camp and kennel have been fantastic for my larger size dog.
