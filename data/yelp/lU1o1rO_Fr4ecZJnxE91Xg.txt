Probably my fav store for Sanrio/Hello Kitty stuff in Vegas. Most official Sanrio stores only carry the current lines, but this one always has a huge variety of styles. Guessing its because they don't have a clearance section to get rid of current stuff, and for once that's a good thing. You get a lot more to choose from and they do also get the current lines too. Sanrio is just one section of the store - its mostly Chinese language books, magazines and DVDs. Pretty big variety of those too

YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(139/365) "Barnes and Noble's Asian Cousin" Mom and Pop were in town and were wondering were they could look for Hello Kitty things for my niece, so after we got our #1 Boba fix, we headed a couple of doors down to Great Wall Bookstore. All kinds of neat trinkets and knickknacks to see here and tons of anime/hello kitty/sanrio stuff too. Books, newspapers, DVDs and magazines are also available here too. Stop in when you're at #1 Boba, You might find something for you or your kid.  ALOHA!!! Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  3
