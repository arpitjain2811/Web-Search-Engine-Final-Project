Absolutely gorgeous condos.  This is my next r.e. purchase.......depressed 5 star Vegas property.   You cannot imagine the views from the balcony and the quality of construction.  Hey, Warren Buffet would be all over this , but it's too late because Carl Icahn already is!

This place is physically amazing; however, Stephanie in customer service is awful.  She is rude and does not care about taking care of her tenants or their guests.

Stephanie is amazing and goes on and above foer every owner!  Stephanie ALWAYS puts owners as a priority!
