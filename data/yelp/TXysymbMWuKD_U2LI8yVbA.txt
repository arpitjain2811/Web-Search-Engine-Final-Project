Very professional and compassionate!

I had been putting off my appointment for three weeks, thanks to the ease of scheduling and rescheduling online--it's as easy as entering your contact and insurance info and selecting a time.  But I HAD to do it eventually...damn primary care physicians.... I don't exactly look forward to having blood drawn at 8 am, especially after fasting for 12 hours, but I was quickly put at ease by the relaxed and confident medical assistant. He was very personable and got my mind off of the vials of blood being extracted from my body. I was bandaged up and ready to go in no time.  If your doctor ever orders lab work, I HIGHLY recommend taking that order to LabCorp. Professional, efficient, personable and relatively painless.

I got what I needed to do done, but the older dude at the front desk, looked like a dude who shouldn't be at a front desk of a clinic. He was dressed like a gardener, but did manage to crack one joke and was nice and offered me a key bit of information. The nurse was way better and my business was done in about 2 minutes. Place is a bit difficult to locate buried among a million other medical warehouses, but efficient and you can make online appointments, which is way better than walking in random. True to form, front desk guy was kicking back and texting as I walked out, but did say goodbye.
