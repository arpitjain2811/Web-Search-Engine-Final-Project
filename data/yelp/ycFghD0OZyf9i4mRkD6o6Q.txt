I've been to at least 4 different Outback's and they are generally the same.  This one seemed a  little nicer.  It wasn't as loud and they didn't so much stuff on the table.  Ya know, like, there's more room for those yummy appetizers! The service was great, as long as you don't mind being asked every 10 minutes how you're doing.. which I don't!

This was my last visit to any Outback. Not a big fan to start with, but my local friends wanted to eat there during one Christmas Eve. We all had the same bad experience... The service was very very very very very slow, and a wrong order. It took us about 45 min to get the foods on the table. We called manager in two occasion... she was very indifferent to the situation... very few apologies uttered and they sounded flat and insincere. There was no attempt to offer us any compensation, not that it would change my impression. Diner beware: It will go Down Under quickly. Don't bother to remember this place.
