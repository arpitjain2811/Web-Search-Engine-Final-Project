I will take Baja Fresh over that other place any time. Any time. This particular place is clean and friendly. I personally stick with the orignal Baja fish tacos.  There is something about their special tangy sauce that I really really like. I also get the express guacamole and chips - made fresh with no wierd additives. The chips are fresh made, I can tell, and I'm so glad they do this. Comfortable seating; an ideal place to have a quick meal.
