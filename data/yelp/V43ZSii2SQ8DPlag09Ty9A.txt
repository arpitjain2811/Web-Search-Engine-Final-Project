Friendly staff, didn't have to wait long for a table (busy Saturday evening) although later arrivals were having to wait up to 20 minutes. Drinks order taken as soon as we sat down, prompt service...but not rushed to order quickly. Both had the 7oz Balmoral Sirloin steak, perfectly cooked to order (rare). Slightly too much haggis for the size of steak but otherwise good portion sizes. The trio of desserts on a wooden board is a nice touch, a choice of six to choose from.

Handy location if you are driving to the Queen Margaret University campus from the south and are looking for lunch. Good food, menu more adventurous than typical pub grub. Let down by sluggish service. We sat for ages with table littered with finished plates, waiting staff were oblivious (it was a quiet Sunday), hence the average rating. If the service was a little snappier it would be four stars.
