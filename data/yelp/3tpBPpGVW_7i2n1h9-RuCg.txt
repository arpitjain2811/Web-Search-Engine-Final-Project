Went to this location to get something for a water filtration system. We were greeted and helped right as we walked in, got the items we needed and were in and out in under 5 minutes! I don't think I've got out of a bigger box chain that fast.

This is a smaller store, but the staff was quick to ask if I needed help, and then took me right to what I was looking for.  Not as much variety as the big box home improvement stores, but they have stuff the big boxes don't (like the item I was looking for). And although the store is small, if you spot an item online you can have it shipped to the store for free and just pick it up there.

Nice staff, very helpful but not always very knowledgeable - even about their own inventory. Prices on most items are 20-30% higher than Home Depot or Lowes.
