This place open in the same location where Quiznos use to be. They're pretty quick to service you.

I just came into town for the day. Needed a quick bite to eat. While I was in line I witnessed the most obnoxious customer who was just down right rude to 3 staff members. Jessie was helping this customer and I was so impressed with how he handled this very rude customer. As I was eating my sandwich I watched this same employee sweep up the lobby and greet everyone walking in and out. My sandwich was good but I was most impressed by the supurb customer service Jessie was providing. Good job Jessie!

Great food. Fresh veggies. Quick and friendly service. Good prices.  Seating areas could be cleaner though, especially since the place was empty when we walked in.  Will probably be back.
