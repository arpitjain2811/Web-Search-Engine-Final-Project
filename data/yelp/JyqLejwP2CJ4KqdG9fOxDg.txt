As a former starbucks barista I know only to expect the best from starbucks but this particular location is my least fav the drinks always taste bad and i leave unhappy so i gave them a few trys and each time they failed so i will no longer visit this location.

I enjoy a soy misto.... but I feel like it how much I enjoy it depends on who is making it.... This Starbucks is pretty hit & miss with their baristas! Not everyone can be a barista... There's a guy that works at this location & he should be making the drinks every time because they always turnout out "PERFECT".... I know by who's making the drink if it is going to be good or not... At at $4+ a drink it sucks if its not good..... Come on Starbucks... figure.... it..... out!

This has been the best Starbucks I have been to in the Valley. They're nice, consistent, QUICK, and have never been hesitant to do the right thing.

My standard starbucks.  Always quick. Always efficient. Always friendly. Get me in and out and back on the way to work without any hassle which is the way stopping for a morning cup of coffee should be.
