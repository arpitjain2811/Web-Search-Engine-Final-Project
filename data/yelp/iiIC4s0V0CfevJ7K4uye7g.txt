Did a walk-in cut.  Forgot her name, but she was a younger blonde girl who was nice.  Though my cut was a tad bit shorter than I had wanted, it still looked really good and overall I was very pleased.  She seemed to know what she was doing.  For the money can't beat it.  Will definitely come back.

Brought in my 11 year old daughter to get a haircut.  While the service was fast and the girl did a great job giving her the cut she wanted,  I wasnt very pleased with the professionalism.  The stylist were talking across the floor about going out and getting drunk the night before. I'm sorry but I don't feel that is appropriate when you have clients around,  especially a little girl.
