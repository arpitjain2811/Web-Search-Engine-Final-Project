Everything that's great, awkward and weird about Willy comes together in a people packed street fest that's pretty rad if you have the time and patience to navigate through some crunchy situations.

'Silly Willy' as I now call it is full of kooky fancifulness from stilt walkers to face painters, beer stands, robot espresso makers, and even murals to draw on :)  EVERYONE has fun.   Can't wait for next year!

Just a mere half a block from my house, Willy Street Fair is something I will look forward to for years to come! Two days of sheer shenanigans. Expect costumes, great music, beer, delicious local food, amazing local artists, and an all around good time. This event is the epitome of what makes Willy Street unique!

This fair is a blast. You will not find a better block party in Madison. Four stages with live music, great food and always something unexpected to delight and surprise you. The people-watching here is phenomenal.
