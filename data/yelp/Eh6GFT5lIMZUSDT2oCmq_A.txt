Gary and the guys at Ideal Body did a fantastic job repainting my car after it was badly keyed at a Badger game. They had just moved to their new location in the old Thorstad dealership, but were ready to provide quick, quality work. They handled the insurance company with aplomb. Highly recommended.

I would absolutely recommend Gary and Ideal Body Shop.  After an accident without collision insurance, we really needed the best rates.  I compared a few other local body shops and Gary beat them on price.  Even more, he suggested a few ways I could save even more than he quoted. Gary had great communication, answered the phone the first ring every time, and kept me up-to-speed on the repairs. Ideal and Gary earned a customer for life!

I scrapped my car twice in the same day, and the guys here were amazing. Honest, quick, and quality work. Awesome, awesome place!
