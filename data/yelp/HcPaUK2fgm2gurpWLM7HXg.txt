I LOVE River Ridge. It is clean, staff is friendly, they have great vets and the rates are terrific. What more could you want.

We take our now 9 month Bull Terrier. We've taken Rex here since we bought him at three months. All of the staff there loves him, they're really kind with him since we know he's a real handful. We've only taken him to one other Vet but only because it was in the middle of the night.
