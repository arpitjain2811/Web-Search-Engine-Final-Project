Unless you are having a birthday party- don't even try to visit this place on the weekend. I have tried to shop this store twice in the past couple of months and each time I go in- am shuffled to the side and not allowed to move as the bday party girls do a fashion show. Great for the bday kids, but not so great for innocent shopper trying to purchase a few items. If you're going to just do private parties then close the store. Owner seemed annoyed we even came in- and was very unhelpful. No thanks- will take my daughter and money elsewhere.

They did my daughter's birthday party last year. I was very impressed. They got their hair, makeup, and nails done. Each girl got to choose a tiara to wear and keep. They even got to bring home some makeup and nail Polish. My daughter and her friends loved the experience! She wants to do it again this year :)"
