Been going to Dr David P Nelson for 6 years. Good natured staff is well informed and gives tons of info about the various parts of the exams, the billing process, and contact lens and glasses sales.  You will leave your appointment knowledgeable about the health of your eyes and your eyesight.

As a very proactive optometrist, you can immediately tell that Dr. Nelson is dedicated to making sure that your eyes are healthy and that you are given all the information that you need to make the appropriate decisions about your care.   It also helps that he's a super-friendly guy with a very easy going manner.   And don't forget to take your fish oil and wear your sunglasses!

Dedicated to your eye health. Excellent doctors and care all around. I have normally seen Dr. Nelson but had the chance to see their newest addition, Dr. Radke.  She is outstanding.  Thorough, thoughtful, and very caring.  Can't recommend this group enough.
