This store has just about everything from paper goods, glass ware to tools and a lot in between.  There is not a lot of places where you can still buy flypaper.  Despite the name, not every item is 99 cents.  Everything is pretty cheap though.   Every time I go in there I just walk around the store just to look at all the different things they sell.
