Taco Bell is Taco Bell...

God, I'm reviewing Taco Bell. My husband picked me up a nachos bel grande, I think it's the fanciest nacho they have on the menu (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). By fancy I mean meat (I wonder if they're still using pink slime meat), beans, nacho cheese, tomatoes and sour cream shlopped on a handful of chips. Why are you rating TB's nachos you ask? They frickin loaded this sucker with toppings. Seriously loaded it so much that I had more shlop than chips. Usually you have to take a plain chip and steal the toppings from another chip, in the end the original chip with toppings is nothing but a soggy floppy chip. Not this nacho bel grande, not this Taco Bell. GO TB!

How do you review Taco Bell? They are all pretty much the same. I come here for lunch sometimes and it's ok. The location is in a high traffic area. The thing that bugs me is they serve ice tea, but no lemons just limes...really just limes?
