My favorite soul food joint in Vegas!! Very small restaurant with a simple decor. The best seafood gumbo I have had in a very long time. Catfish is always fresh and the cornbread is pipin' hot!!  Make sure to check out the live jazz bands throughout the week!! Perfect setting for a glass of wine, good food and great music!!
