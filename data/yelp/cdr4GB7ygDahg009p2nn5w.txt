I enjoy a cup of coffee, an American right before my off road mountain biking in the Phoenix Mountain Preserve.  The coffee is OK, not great.  They do have sandwiches and pastries.   The shop has great potential, but generally it is unoccupied and appears cluttered.  I feel that the prices on food is high.   The place has all the right elements for a terrific coffee shop, but none of the chemistry.

I am in town visiting and stopped at Shea for lunch. I actually had a breakfast sandwich/bagel even though it was 1pm (they said you can have breakfast anytime!).  The service was great and it was very cute inside. There are tables and they have free wi-fi so it would be a great place to meet clients for a casual meeting. They also have a drive-thru if you want to grab a quick cup of coffee.

If you ever find yourself at the corner of Shea & 32nd Street you really need to stop by this little hole-in-the-wall joint! The owner is the nicest guy, and I feel bad for him simply because these are the types of shops hit hardest during crappy financial times like these. He has let most of his employees go and cut back on his hours - BUT there are a few things here that are truly AMAZING!!!! 1. Iced green tea - it is so delicious I crave it. It's about $2 for a HUGE one... (thats what she said) 2. breakfast sandwiches - they taste just like your mom's. Seriously. Bagel or english muffin, real cheese, real egg, the ham is my fav.  3. Tuna sandwich - they put water chestnuts in the mix - it gives the sandwich this crunchy goodness - I swear!  They have a very tiny inside area with a few tables, but a nice little outdoor patio area. I heart this freakin' place, and you will too!
