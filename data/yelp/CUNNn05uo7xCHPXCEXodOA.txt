Very knowledgeable staff and friendly.

The store was very neat and tidy when I walk in.  However, one time when I asked if they sold Playstation 2 video games anymore, the sales clerk said with a rude attitude that they don't because they're considered older versions.  Regardless of this episode, it is still an ok place to shop.

This Gamestop is in Desert Ridge and has friendly service and a good selection of new and used games.  Gamestop in general is great because they will buy back your old games.  I like that :)!!

Charlene should do a workshop for every other game trading establishment around the valley. She was excellent. All by herself in a busy store helping everyone in the with above average customer service. Everyone in the store left with a smile. Charlene really knows her stuff you can tell she loves her job. I will never go to play n trade again.
