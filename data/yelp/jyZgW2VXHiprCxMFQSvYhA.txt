During the winter, Tenney Park has the best ice skating in the city. Huge pond and generally well kept ice. Skate rental is $6 for an hour. Very cool. During the summer, it's a bit run-down and outdated. A cool running path and some basketball/soccer courts are in the middle of a moat-like pond. However, thanks to the pond, there are lots of mosquitoes. The beach, pier, and locks are awesome to check out. Lots of fisherman, but generally quiet and a neat view of the city.

I came here to put in my kayak on Lake Mendota and do some fishing so, I didn't actually get to spend much time in the park, per se.  However, from what I have seen, and driving by the skating rinks in winter, Tenney Park is quite a nice park, located so close to downtown Madison....if only we could do something about the water quality in the lakes  :(
