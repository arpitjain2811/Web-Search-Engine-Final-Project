The first CVS I've been to in YEARS where an employee walked up and offered to help me find something.

Thank you ladies who helped me in the pharmacy tonight. I'm glad you're open late at the same time I'm sorry you have to work late  Everyone is always so nice here when I've come in. I didn't catch both the ladies names in the pharmacy but Katie was on my receipt. Thank you again!!! Very nice and friendly.

It seems every time I come to this Pharmacy, they are not organized or they promise a time and it's never ready. I'll go to the one on 3975 E. Thunderbird, Phoenix, AZ 85032. Ask for Mary! She's the best!! This place has horrible service in Pharmacy!
