L'Occitane en Provence is my go to shop for many beauty products.  First off, the products are cruelty free and totally lux.  I have few favorite smells that I must wear and one of them is L'Occitane's Green Tea spray-- it is magical.  Other items are that are to die for: Shea Butter Hand Cream Cherry Blossom Lotion Immortelle under eye cream Marseille Soaps These items can only be purchased in a L'Occitane.  Shopping inside is like being taken away into a whole little vacation world.  If you have never been inside a L'Occitane, let me recommend that you must stop by at least once-- you'll be running back for more. It sure helps that the shops employees are always so nice and friendly and want to give you samples of stuff.  Every store I've been to in different states and they are consistently helpful and friendly.   I love L'Occitane!

Great, great stuff.  Love the mango lotion and the regular hand cream.
