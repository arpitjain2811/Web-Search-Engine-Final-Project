RUDE! Seriously, this place is near my house so I called for an oil change and the guy said he could do it right then, so I drive down there and go inside... The guy behind the counter was nothing but rude. He looked at me like I must be stupid since I'm a girl of course, then spoke to me like a jerk father would scold his 5 year old son. They also do not offer synthetic oil... oh but if you bring in your own they'll use it. Lame! I was so irritated I walked out. I'll drive a little further for some good service, thanks!

Went in today for a set of tires.The price was close to other shops i went to. The people i dealt with where fine, they put on the tires, i paid. people today expect shops to bend over backwards for them, not going to happen. as they say it is what it is. if i needed tires i would go back.
