It closes. Like twice to three times a day.  There is a reason they are able to sell $6 loaves of bread. Because, it is a "CONVENIENCE" store. However when a "CONVENIENCE" store closes, it ceases to be "CONVENIENT" I think they have their movies mixed up and are playing hockey on the roof.  Then..the fucking money order thing was down..she said "come back tomorrow" I said "Fuck You."

I normally do not frequent these establishments because they are usually filthy and disgusting. Today however I needed to stop on my way to work at 5 am to buy coffee. First off the "clerk" was wearing a hoodie with it on his head, he looked like a gangster tall and lanky with this hood attached on his head. He was bothered that he had to stop texting on his phone to ring up my coffee purchase. The store was so unbelievably filthy that he could have taken the time to clean it instead of texting. Then when I got to work (about 4 miles away) I took a sip of my coffee to discover that it was ICE COLD (and that is NOT what I chose) . Now I know why I do not frequent this chain and I will NEVER step foot in another one again.
