The One Below is a club which oozes class.  Situated below the Rutland Hotel, this club is a place I go when I am suited and want to experience how the other half live! Inside, the club has a number of booths on either side of the bar, a bar which offers a mixture of cocktails (The Full Metal Jacket is one not to be missed by whisky drinkers!) and offers champagnes ranging from £50 a bottle to £450!!!  But after staring at prices in the menu for ages at the bar, another surprise awaits you in the booths! Some of the booths have I-pod docks! Yes, bring along your music and turn it up in your own private booth! The I-pod docks again, emphasises the coolness of the place. The One Below, is a great place if you want to experience the suaveness of cool club nights, however indulging in the drinks on offer does come at a heavy price. But for me, well worth a visit every so often!
