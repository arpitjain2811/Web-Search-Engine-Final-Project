Sadly this one is closed. I found so much at this one. Went to the Meadows Mall last weekend and noticed that it's some generic body care store. This one was bigger than the Blvd. Mall/Miracle Mile Shops locations, and had really good selection.  Get the member card, subscribe to the e-mail list, and shop the sales. I really love the Body Butter products ( mango, coconut, shea butter, vitamin E, cocoa butter, raspberry, just to name a few), the gifts (no-brainer gift idea), and the foot kits (great as gifts, but I use it too).  Am the only one that thinks this is funny that one can still write reviews for something's that's closed?

They just re-opened at Meadows Mall. Store is across from Victoria's secret. I rarely shop here, but customer service at this location was excellent. Two thumbs up for the girls working here.  They were very knowledgeable and helped 2 male customers pick things for their wives.  They even provided a little jar so you can take a sample home.  As part of the Grand opening special, they are offering a free one year membership card to the body shop with purchase ($10 value at Meadows Mall location only), and if you spend $30 or more you get a gift set with Satsuma scented products and a lotion.   The great thing was that I was able to use my Groupon on any items in the store, including sale items. Score!
