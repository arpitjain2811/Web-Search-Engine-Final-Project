This bank of America has the best customer service in my opinion! Not too busy all the time like other locations. 24 hour ATM machines are always helpful.

I'd have to agree with Jane! I've been to dozens of Bank of America locations, but this one has the best service by far. In general I can't say I'm overly thrilled with BofA, but I'm pleased this location is so close to the house and has such great employees.

I have never been to a bank where they work thru the line so quickly. The tellers are friendly and effective. There is always a candy bowl filled with something good. But you may not have time to enjoy it as you will be in and out before you can say Jolly Rancher. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!

Banking with B of A is always a pleasure. Never had any issues with this location. This location has been there for a long time. The only thing that bothered me is that they require an appointment for a notary. WTF! That's ridiculous. It only takes 5 minutes or less to sign and stamp the damn piece of paper. I use to be one too. I'm sorry but half the things that needs to be notarized are important documents which means it needs to be expedited quickly to its destination. Anyway, so much for "service" for your customers. They made me give my business to PostNet across the lot.  Don't waste your time going there for notary just head straight across the parking lot to PostNet for $5.  Appointment for notary is stupid.
