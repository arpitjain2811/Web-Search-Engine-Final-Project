Beware of the car wash!  Nobody cares and it does a crappy job.  Parts are falling off.  Rollers have fallen off and can slice your tires.  The brushes leave dirt strips on you car.  BEWARE!  It's not worth going there anymore.  Their sun shade has fallen off so they just put street cones around it and leave it that way for weeks (months?)!  It screams absentee owner!  I warned you!  I don't think it's a City Stop anymore.
