As far as charity shops go, this one has to really up the ante since it's situated right on the Royal Mile! It is thus very well ordered, has acquired a lot of stock, and is heaving with clothes. Everything in here is pressed to perfection and it seems to collect some high end donations from kind customers. I always get excited visiting this branch of P.D.S.A because they have a knitting corner full of old 60s pattern books, not to mention an entire section dedicated to vintage! They have some amazing jumpers and vinyl in this section and one of the railings is dedicated to clothing made in the UK.  Prices for jumpers are through the roof considering they were likely given out the kindness of someone's heart - they are using the Urban Outfitters model of labelling, so you could spend up to Â£25 for a jumper out of here. But unlike Urban Outfitters, the money is going to help cats, rather than straight into the hands of gleeful fat cats. So it's gotta be worth it. Besides, people are less likely to be wearing something you'd find out of this PDSA than mass produced - sorry, "re produced" stuff out of the high street leeches. A store worth visiting, I admire their style!
