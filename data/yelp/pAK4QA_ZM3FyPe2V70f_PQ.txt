One of the best cab rides I've ever had with very knowledgeable cabbies and the prices are not thru the roof.

Decent cab service with OK prices... for Vegas. The driver was fairly entertaining but couldn't drive worth a damn. It was a short trip to the airport, and he hooked me up with extra receipts to cover up the drinking expenses on the business trip, which is always nice ;)

All cab drivers are sneaky..we had our phone GPS on during our ride and he went the long way..we made it back quicker on the bus later that night.
