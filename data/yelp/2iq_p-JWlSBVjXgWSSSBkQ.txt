I live near this location and have been many times, so I can say from experience that it's fantastic. I have never known their staff to be anything short of exceptionally friendly & hard working, and their food has never been anything but exceptional as well, not to mention really really tasty. The store itself always looks and smells like it's just been cleaned, which is highly appreciated, and they even accept the coupon card that I got for a different location. Overall, this is a great place to get inexpensive, high-quality, freshly prepared take-&-bake pizza. (P.S. I'm not affiliated with this company, I just go there legitimately all the time & love the place)

I never understood the idea of going to a fast good place AND baking your food yourself, but the pizza is decent and they accept ebt. I had the BBQ chicken pizza and it needed more BBQ sauce. Other than that, very good.

Very good service and pizza. Love there new pan pizza. I think its one of the best I have ever had. The toppings are always fresh.
