My office is right across the street, so I eat here at least once a month. The employees are always nice, the place is clean and always busy.

This location is just down the street from where I work, so it's perfect for me to get in and out of in a jiffy. Very friendly crew here. They work hard and fast to get customers their food in a timely manner. My food was so delicious and fresh!  I know I will definitely be back there for lunch and since they also serve breakfast, I will try that as well.
