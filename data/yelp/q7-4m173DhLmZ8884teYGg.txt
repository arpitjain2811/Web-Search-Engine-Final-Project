This place was neither bad nor great.  It was just ok.  Staffed with one person in the middle of the day.  The guy behind the counter was a little bit slow.  But, for a location in a gas station, I didn't expect much.  I'd hope they have someone better working the morning rush.  The donuts are still the best.  I can't stand Krispy Kream.
