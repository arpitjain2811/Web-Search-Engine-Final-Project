A lot quicker and friendlier to deal with as compared to ANY Pharmacy.

This is a great gem. A cute little quaint pharmacy. And the staff are very knowledgable and helpful. It's surprising from all the chaos from big chains. Great staff, convenient location, surprisingly calm surrounding. Very nice.  Yes I think I shall come back.
