I was really surprised by the hair cut I got here.  The salon was really clean,open and the dresser was very friendly. It was a little pricey, but I got a really great cut and blow out. Return factor? Yep!

Only place I go and have gone to for over 3 years.  Anyone you ask in there knows who I am and that I come in weekly.  Love it!!  I would tell you who I see, but that might make me getting an appointment harder!!  HAHA
