What's to say. Sometimes you just gotta give in to guilty pleasures. All day breakfast!  I get the sausage egg and cheese biscuit without the sausage and cheese. I'm trying!

This was one the best Jack in the Box's that we had ever been to.  The staff was very friendly and it was always very clean. Sadly it closed today.
