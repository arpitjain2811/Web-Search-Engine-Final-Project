I went to see Lisa for three appointments in Feb./ March 2011. She is great! Totally professional, but also empathetic and kind. She makes you feel completely comfortable, and explains all the treatments and what they do for your body and mind  before she administers them. Her office is clean and comfortable, in an upscale area with ample parking. No complaints! Would recommend her to anyone seeking acupuncture (which, incidentally, didn't hurt at all -- it was my first experience, but I literally did not feel the needles at all).

I can't believe I've forgotten to write a review for Lisa!  I've been working with her now for over a year and she always helps find the issues that have physically run me down.  Lisa is very caring and listens to what the issues are that you are having before setting you up on the table then poking you with needles.   I really can't recommend her enough whether you have an acute issue that only requires a few visits or a chronic one like me that may require several visits over a longer period of time.

Lisa is so knowledgeable and honest. She's very detailed in her explanations and has a caring atmosphere. It was my first acupuncture ever and I left informed and ready to take control of my pain with my end at home. She's also honest with her patients. She wants what's best for you even if you should be treated with western medicine.
