My tips lasted 4 weeks with very minmal lifting! And they did an awesome job. Also, their pedicures are amazing! The ladies are all wonderful and very courteous. A joy to spend an afternoon getting pampered.

Nice place! I had a horrible experience at another nail salon so I wanted to try this one out and I had a much better time here.  I only got the gel nail polish with a French nail style but seriously considering coming back again in a couple of weeks and maybe getting a pedicure too! :)

Wonderful massage chairs that have the full head neck back shiatsu style massagers in them. Three levels of pedicures ranging in prices from 25-45..I picked the mid level one that included callus removal, sugar scrub, extended massage, hot stone and towels. .walked out after an hour plus spoiling feeling great. I will be back

My card was charged for more than I signed for. I gave the lady who did my nails a generous cash tip because she specifically asked for cash and then she added another tip to my card after I signed. That is illegal. When I went in and showed them my bank record and my receipt they told me it's the banks issue. Not to mention it's just another salon where all the Asian nail technicians are talking about you right in front of you. Needless to say, I would never go back here again.
