LOVE me some Cold Stone!  My new latest fav is Devil's Brew which is Coffee ice cream, mixed with chocolate brownie, chocolate & caramel topping.  Staff is always friendly!  Look for coupons in most Sunday papers too!

It's cold stone. Pretty tasty, overpriced ice cream served by disinterested teenage girls. Still worth coming for an ice cream for my birthday.

Always a very guilty pleasure. I don't remember what it's called but the one that mixes waffle cone into the ice cream is freakin' delicious. Obviously not good for the health conscious Surprisian, but as a treat every once and a while it is delicious.
