Perfecta did a great job with my massage. She was very knowledgable and professional. I would def recommend her for anyone needing some relaxation and relief from muscle pain and tension.

She did a great job! I like pretty firm pressure, not those froo froo massages where the touch is so light that it makes you think they are going to start stripping. She actually maintained excellent pressure where it was firm but not painful. Place was very nice and is someone definitely worth going to.
