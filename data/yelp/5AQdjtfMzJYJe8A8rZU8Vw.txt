The place need a bid of upgrade, but the food is awesome.  I got the Campechana cocktail.

The shrimp tasted fresh but the meal was WAY over priced. 10 very small shrimp, a small salad, a small portion of refried beans, and a small portion of rice for $12.95. I won't be back.

I had high expectations but was let down. The quality of food was nothing special. For the price I paid, I could get much more food at restaurants that prepare from scratch. I felt ripped off after paying my bill.

I come in at least once a month since i work close by. Fast service...ceviche is always great. Have had the sopes and flautas and i have paid more for really bad food. I think its a great spot!
