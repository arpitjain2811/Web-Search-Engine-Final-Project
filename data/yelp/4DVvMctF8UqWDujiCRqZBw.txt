Below average Starbucks service here.  Some of the younger kids working here don't seem to understand service.  Desserts are sometimes stale/hard.  The line moves very, very slowly here and you just don't see the usual sense of urgency in the workers when it's like this.

Very slow service & expect to feel like an outsider at this location. I went in & was skipped over in line as they began "regulars" orders ahead of mine. I spent over $40 on beverages & food and not so much as a thank you. Meanwhile they are talking up a storm with the regular clientele. Drinks finally ready & they are out of trays. When I placed an order for 5 beverages, how did you think I would get them to the car? No offer of assistance, the employee just acted like she couldn't see me. I'll be frequenting a different Starbucks.

Love this place. Love how they redesigned the whole entire inside! Super fast service and workers are always nice!
