This is a pretty typical CVS location. Conveniently located for me to pick up the random prescription or health & beauty item. Those are typically the only things I come here for. The staff is usually pretty friendly and their pharmacy is efficient. They have a drive thru drop off and pick up for prescriptions, but I have never utilized that service. I've never had to wait long for help and the lines at the register are never too long. It's a nice place to shop for after holiday discounted candy and treats as well. Overall, a good CVS location.
