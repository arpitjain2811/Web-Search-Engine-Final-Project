Very honest and reasonably priced, he replaced our radiator in a day!

We've been taking our Hondas to High Road for over a year, now, and  always get honest, fast, good service at a fair price.  We found Tom through a friend after getting a very high estimate at another repair shop. Tom gave us a totally different diagnosis which solved the problem and only cost us about $100, compared to the nearly $1,000 quote from the other shop. We've been going here ever since.

I have brought my vehicles here for over 3 years now and I can say that Tom is excellent, fair and knowledgable but more importantly he is honest.  That is the bet trait he has and he enjoys what he does. Imports only for the most part but it never hurts to call and ask. You will not be sorry- trust me! He is good people!! :)

We have been bringing our cars to Tom for years now. I usually have trouble trusting mechanics but not in this case. Several times our estimates actually ended up being higher than the bill when the work was finished. You won't find that elsewhere. I'm glad High Road was recommended to me. Very fair, reasonable and good work.
