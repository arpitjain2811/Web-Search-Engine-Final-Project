Between flights, we decided to grab a cocktail or two from the Cabo Wabo Cantina. It looked like a nice spot to rest until it was time to go yet again.  For my first drink, I ordered the Tequila Sunrise. It was a bit too sweet and had to add a little club soda. My guy ordered a beer and as a finale, we ordered the Cabo Wabo Margarita. That was pretty good and in a nice big glass.  Our Bartender was very nice, accommodating and had a nice conversation with.  I guess they see their fare share of people from everywhere, every single day.

Unless you are a complete Vegas drunk with no where else to go, well, I guess that's your spot. Loud, obnoxious and greasy. That is about the very best I can offer to this crowded, loud, very dirty spot. The food was microwaved, and greasy. I just won't go on, except avoid it.
