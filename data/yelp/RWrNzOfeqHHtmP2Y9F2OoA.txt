Only come here for the Jeff Lewis paint line. The staff is unbearably slow each time we come here. There are three employees for a fairly steady flow of customers. If Jeff Lewis Color was sold elsewhere, I'd never shop here.

Dunn Edwards paint is professional quality and pro selection. Their color matching is top notch with great service . As far as the Jeff Lewis comment in the previous review, it is made by Dunn Edwards they just double the price because of the designer name so do yourself a favor and get a premium dunn Edwards paint. It's half the price and same quality .great job guys! Luke Brush and Ladder Specialty Paint llc
