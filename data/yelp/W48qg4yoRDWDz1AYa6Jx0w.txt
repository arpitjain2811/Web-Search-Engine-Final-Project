I hear they are good for banners, etc. But I needed business cards and saw one of several signs outside that read "$18 Business Cards" so I turned around and went back and went inside. I was greeted and I said I saw your sign for business cards. Young man said great here are our prices and turned the computer screen around and the lowest price available was $74 up to $259.  He never spoke again as if waiting for me to make a selection. Is that the best price? "Yes". Thanks but no thanks....exit. "Have a nice day" lol. This is a sign company with horribly misleading signs promoting their "own endeavors",  Should I decide to engage in misleading advertising I'm sure this place would come to mind first. Perhaps the most entertaining thing about this place though is the total lack of personality. These guys are like flatliner robots. Clearly everyone here lingered last in line when personalities were dispersed.

I have had several banners made here. They have been of very high quality and have exceeded my expectations every time. I usually give the designer a vague description of what I want, and he always comes up with something amazing. Great price, done quickly, nice people to work with.

i have been going to the same printing company since i opened my business, about a year ago. however, when i decided to get the feather flags, he was just out of my budget. i lucked out when the business next to me got them, and were kind enough to give me a card to this company. i will say, i felt a bit as if i were cheating on my graphic designer, but all guilt has since evaporated when i saw the incredible and beautiful job that Ramy did. not only was he patient in his explanation, even bring out a sample for me to hold to test the weight of the item, but he did such an AMAZING job with the design, even taking an initiative by putting things on the flags, that i didn't even think of. i will DEFINITELY be coming to them in the future for other marketing needs.
