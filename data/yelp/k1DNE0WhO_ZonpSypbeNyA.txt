....my hair looks fine, but I swear to God the young lady cutting it was intentionally jabbing me with the sheers.

I've tried Toni & Guy twice over the last 5 years, otherwise had a friend cut my hair. It was time to get a professional cut again and I figured I'd try Supercuts in my neighborhood. I had no prior experience with Supercuts but would have expected from hair salons in the past: - That they'd wash my hair before cutting, not use a water spray bottle - That it takes more than 10 minutes to cut and trim hair that hadn't been cut in 6 months. - That they'd offer a mirror to see the back when asking if it looked ok. - That they'd dry my hair!!!! I left the store with my hair wet and combed back. No idea what I'd look like. When I got home and dried it, the left ear had a strand of hair an inch longer than the right. The back wasn't layered and all kinds of uneven hairs were flipping and sticking out. Wound up taking scissors and "fixing" it myself. While friendly and inexpensive, I would not use them again.

Nothing to rave about, but certainly worth the money they were charging. They are often busy, which means I have to wait up to an hour to get my hair cut.
