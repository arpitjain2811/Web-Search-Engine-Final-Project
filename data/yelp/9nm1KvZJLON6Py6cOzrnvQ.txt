I wanted to like this place, I really did...seeing as I am from SF, I thought - how perfect! A little slice of North Beach here in Phoenix. Not so much, as it turns out. The meat, cheese and other toppings were great and generous, and I love the sauce they use on the sandwiches, but the bread is terrible. I am not sure if I had stale bread or what, but it was chewy and dry - I couldn't even finish my sandwich. Very disappointing, especially given the price.

Deli?? I did not see a meat slicer, a display case with meats and cheeses to choose from? The menu is just a list items to make sandwich with? Jersey Mikes now that is a deli!
