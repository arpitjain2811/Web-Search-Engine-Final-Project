I'm not a fan of this walgreens for a few simple reasons. There is always a line at checkout, the store closes at 10pm, and that screws me because the redbox machine is inside.

Totally OK. Employees are mostly friendly as well as helpful. The store is clean. And checkout is quick.  To leave the shop going south on Hayden you have to battle the fatty McDonald's traffic, but it's easy-peasy otherwise.

Great location and friendly service.

The old lady at the checkout is extremely RUDE! The manager is ever more RUDE! Stay away from this store at all costs!
