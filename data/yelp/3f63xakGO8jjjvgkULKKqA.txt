Mct oil buy 2 get the second half off. Good deal. The employees were pestering me to buy stuff even after I told them I knew what I was looking for.

Just dropped in real quick to try out some Quest bars and the guy there was really knowledgable and friendly. I'm hate walking into health stores like this and feeling like someone us over my shoulder like GNC sometimes but they weren't like that at all. First time here and I'm sure I'll be back.

I buy ProMax bars here pretty regular. Their prices are about average on protein/workout supplement products, but they seem to be the only place that carries the lemon flavored promax for some reason. Store reps are always giving samples to me of stuff I'm frankly not going to use, but I guess they gotta try to sell stuff, so no harm no foul there. As long as you don't mind the occasionally over-zealous sales person it's an alright place.
