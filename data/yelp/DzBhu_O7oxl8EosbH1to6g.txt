Needed some insurance for the purchase of a second home..  Anthony in this office did a great job getting me a quote and putting the package together when we closed.  Timely response and good service.  Only 4 stars because I don't want them to get too cocky. :)  Highly recommended!

First off, I've been with this agency for a few years and every time i've need help they have always done right by me. I'm currently looking to add an additional vehicle to my policy so I contacted the agency and was help out by Luz Tolentino. Every question i had for her she had a response almost instantly, her extensive knowledge and great personality will definitely have me referring people to her and keep me around for a while.

These guys are awesome! No pressure to buy anything, and they take their time explaining everything I had questions about. Got car and life insurance in the past here, now choosing them for my renters insurance! This branch is the best!!!

This was my first time getting my own car insurance, and they made it super easy. I did the quote online and they were able to pull it up in the office. Good prices and the staff were friendly and helpful.

Eric and his team rock! Eric carefully made sure I could get all the discounts possible for my home and car. I was never presented with an up-sell and everyone knew what they were doing. I was in and out in a single visit and left with everything I needed insured taken care of and at a lower rate than I was paying prior. Two thumbs way up for this business.
