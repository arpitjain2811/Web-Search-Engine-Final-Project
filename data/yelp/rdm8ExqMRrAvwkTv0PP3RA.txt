Jerry was fantastic!  My carpets look brand new.  He is not only a professional but friendly and nice.  He gave me a very fair price and helped get rid of terrible pet stains.  I couldn't be happier.  Also everyone with the company is very nice and helpful.  Highly recomend.

Professional, Courteous and knowledgable. I have had First Choice clean my carpets numerous times and there is no other business I would give my money to. If you want your carpets done right then First Choice is your only choice.
