I am a frequent Subway patron, but I will not patron this franchise again. I am also a supporter of our local High School sports teams. When I presented a discount card from Boulder Creek HS, the manager REFUSED to honor the card. Please do not support this Subway franchise as they do not support our schools and sports teams.

I got the tuna on honey oat with veggies. Everything was fresh, and the tuna salad had the right amount of mayo, imo. Not too much like at some locations! I have ordered this particular sandwich many times, and this was a perfect example of why. It's not amazing, but it's pretty good, especially for a quick, inexpensive, and healthier lunch. The store was clean, the employees were friendly, and this is a convenient location for me. I also liked that there is a designated handicap table. I actually go to a lot of Subways, and I must say this was rare to find. I would come back.
