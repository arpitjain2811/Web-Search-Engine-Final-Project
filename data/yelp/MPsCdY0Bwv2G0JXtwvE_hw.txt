It's hot, but the food ain't bad.

I was severely mislead by Frank A's, "It's hot, but the food ain't bad." review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food I've ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return.

Well, what can you say about Tent City Jail..... "if you don't like it, don't come here" enough said.  they have a volunteer program though that I think is an important part of community.
