Nice clean store, good tea!
6
-Nice essense of plant scent that lures you into the store (actually, just wanted to wash my hands in the store sink - too lazy to find a restroom). -Store is located upstairs in Scottsdale Fashion Square above the food court area. -(Very serious) Store employee offers you some hot tea to sample... -$10.50 starting price for a bottle of shampoo...and this stuff really makes your hair feel CLEAN!!! And the scent leaves your bathroom smelling like a spa! No more crappy $2.50 bottles of shampoo for me! -If you are a first time customer, they will ask you for your contact info to follow-up...um, it's shampoo, not a car. Really? -They will ask you if you want a bag for your purchase (environmental save the earth stuff)...hmmm? Let's see, do I want to walk around the mall with a couple of random shampoo bottles in my pockets? -They have a website you can order from too...some promos offer free shipping and a free sample over a certain amount ($35 or $40).
