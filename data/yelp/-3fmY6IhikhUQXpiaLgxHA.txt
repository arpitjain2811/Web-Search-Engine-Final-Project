I agree with the last reviewer, they have fly problem. We were annoyed with this issue the last time we decided to go inside.

Stupidity is the name of the game here.  Don't ask any questions about anything because no one knows #$% They refuse to park cars with big orders so the whole damn drive up backs up around the building.  Don't bother going in either....goto Subway or Arbys.  They are in the same town and do a better job.
