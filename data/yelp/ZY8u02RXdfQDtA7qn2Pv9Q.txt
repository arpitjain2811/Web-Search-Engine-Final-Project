This place is great. Went in to buy some Nag Champa incense, browsed the selection, good quality pieces at competitive prices.   Did not feel unwanted or a burden to the staff. They were helpful while not being to pushy. The inside looks great clean floors and every  wall is stocked from bongs, papers, hookah, sheesh everything a good smoke shop should carry.   All in all I will be back, since I will no longer have to go to Mill ave for the overpriced products and horrible service, dealing with vagrants  or rude college students. Please go here

Awesome smoke shop and five stars because it's close to my house. The guys that work there are so friendly and helpful and they have a huge selection of literally everything. It's really small, located right next to Dukes Sports Bar.
