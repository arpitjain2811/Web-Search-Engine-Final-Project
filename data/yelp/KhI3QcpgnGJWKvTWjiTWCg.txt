If you like unique pieces of jewelry then head here. I walked past this place today after reading Stephanie T. review. It's true some of the pieces in here are truly amazing but alas will remain a thing of fantasy as my budget is no where near to the prices and plus I have my round the world in a year trip as a priority. However, here is a little piece on the man himself http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/features/-Interview-Joseph-Bonnar-Edinburgh.5854135.jp Worth a browse just for curiosity's sake really and you can be the judge for the pieces and prices.
