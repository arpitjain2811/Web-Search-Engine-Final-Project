I love these stores.  I have been to many.  GREAT options for pizza.  Take it home, bake it yourself.  Hot and fresh out of the oven.  This was a newer location.  Much easier than my other location in Apache Junction.  And they have some new menu options.  Try it.  You won't order delivery again.

While I sat waiting for my Cowboy to be ready....pizza that is- I noticed a young gentlemen I think should be mentioned, unfortunately I didn't catch his name. As he made pizzas he took time to respond and greet  customers, I watched as he spoke  to a small child and made him smile! Young or old that kind of service isn't seen often enough,service with a smile goes a long way! He made at least two customers smile, and this customer will definitely be back! :)

We go here all the time & our favorite employee is Marcos.  Amazing customer service from him every time we've gone there.
