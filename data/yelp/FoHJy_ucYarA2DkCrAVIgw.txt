what the heck. I did smog other car from Jiffy smog on rainbow and paid $19.99. But this place charged me $27; $21 for smog and 6 for VIR fee. Whatever.

So fast, so convenient, less than 5 minutes from our house doesn't hurt either!!! I was smog tested, paid, and registered at the DMV in less than 15 minutes!!! DEFINITELY  bringing the other cars here and ALWAYS coming here!

The person here was one of the most unpleasant people I have ever met.  They wanted to charge me $10 for renewing my registration, which I can do at home, FREE.  Next time, I'll just take it somewhere else.

The guy charged me $30 only to tell me afterward that my car didn't pass because the check engine light was on. Thanks jerk, you could have told me that before you charged me the $30! Then I might have come back to you guys in the future, instead I'll go elsewhere and tell all my friends and family to go elsewhere too! A little kindness could have gone a long way in my book.
