Cool, laid-back staff. Everything is cheaper than at Riley's down the street (except cigarettes). Pretty decent selection for its size.

The only place I will buy alcohol in Madison. The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere of the store is unbeatable. They are always running super good deals on booze which is good if your on a budget.

Quintessential college liquor store. They have all the macro brews that any store would have plus a decent selection of micros (Wisconsin and national), as well as several shelves of all types of liquor and some of the cheapest wine around. Not to mention everything here is a few bucks cheaper than at riley's or regent liquor. Lately they've been promoting their make your own six pack, and even though their selection of singles is relatively small, at $8.49 it is easily the best deal around (even cheaper than woodman's!). Their other specials are also worth looking at (10% off wines on Wednesday, $1 off 12 packs Tuesday). The store is decked out in Wisconsin sports and beer swag, the owners and employees are friendly and chill, and since there is FREE keg delivery this is the cheapest place to get a 1/2 barrel downtown.  When I'm too lazy or hungover to drive to the east side woodman's, I get my booze fix here.
