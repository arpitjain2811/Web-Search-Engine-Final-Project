Great deals - Five tacos for $5.00 and lots of meat.  I really like the salsa bar too!

Cheap delicious Mexican food. At lunch, the place is filled with Spanish-speaking workers so you know it's authentic and good. Love their flour tortillas!

Dropped by this location for lunch one day.  At first glance at the sign, I thought it was an "ertos" restaurant...so I was hoping to add to my list, but alas I was wrong.  Anyway, back to the food...I ordered: Beans Rice Cheese Burrito, $3.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=h7C-FELeuWn6jQmMYTNCpQ#h7C-FELeuWn6jQmMYTNCpQ Carne Asada Taco, $2.70 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=G3gvbjKUYUrbUdw-HTAe3g#G3gvbjKUYUrbUdw-HTAe3g Carnitas Taco, $2.70 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=JZZ49x4O5tCsDBnZ-o469w#JZZ49x4O5tCsDBnZ-o469w http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=71Hp0jEjm3UHZBKwYEcbpQ#71Hp0jEjm3UHZBKwYEcbpQ Med Diet Coke, $1.55 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=pU-8Lht5NSkG0460_w6mEA#pU-8Lht5NSkG0460_w6mEA While I was waiting for my order, I went to the Salsa Bar to load up.  I saw that they had the typical Green & Red runny, mild Salsa and some Chunky Spicy Salsa...yes!  I like spicy, so I grabbed a few cups and filled them up.  Slight problem though...the cups for the Salsa were the soft, paper like cups typically used for Ketchup & Mustard.  You're probably wondering why that's a problem?  Well, it's because when you fill it up with Salsa, it becomes wet and soft and very difficult to carry in your hand because it spills all over the place....yep, it was very messy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=g1dj4KmtgcSb0p46KFcaHA#g1dj4KmtgcSb0p46KFcaHA The food came out a short while later and I started with the Carne Asada Taco....it is a pretty big portion for Street Tacos.  The portion size was the only positive though....the meat was bland....and the Guacamole and Pico de Gallo that was on the Taco didn't help much. Next was the Carnitas Taco.  This one had slight more flavor and was a little better than the Carne Asada....however, it was average at best. Last but not least was the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito.  This was very good.  Some Mexican Joints like these have oily BRC Burritos...but not here.  There was no oil and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The Tortilla was very good as well. Overall, my experience here was average...3 Stars.  If I do come back, it would be strictly for the BRC Burrito. Return Factor - 50%

My first time here, My wife and I decided to swing on in and try the food late one night around 12. I had the carne Asada burrito and she had the steak fajita burrito. Both were super bomb and neither burrito dripped grease everywhere which is a definite plus over filibertos.
