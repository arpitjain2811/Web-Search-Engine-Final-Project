There's not too much you can say about a pharmacy so I'll keep it brief.  The pharmacists are nice but I wouldn't go so far as saying friendly, they hardly crack a smile.  What makes me happy is that they're really good at getting my prescriptions done within about 10-15 minutes of when I drop it off so I don't have to wait too long.

I am visiting here, and forgot a medication at home.  Clerks were sympathetic, helpful, and graciously provided me with the number of pills I needed, FREE of charge.  So pleased with the help, service and attitude at this pharmacy by all who work there!
