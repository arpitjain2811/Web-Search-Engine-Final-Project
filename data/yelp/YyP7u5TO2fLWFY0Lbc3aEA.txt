Good shoe selection within the brand, including the normal and wide sizes - but most importantly, they have larger sizes in stock for those of us who are tall.  There's a few good sales recently and I've picked up one of the top of the line shoes at a hefty discount.  Socks, insoles and other attire are decent here, but it's primarly the shoes that draw people in here.

Love this store.  There is always something in stock in my size in whatever color or style I am looking for.  They even had my husbands 14 EEEEEE (yes, 6 E's) in stock.  Outfitted the whole family in less than 15 minutes and we were outta there.  HAPPY feet all around.

What a great staff, excellent service and a place that remembers that "Customers" are the way the bills get paid. Although I didn't have time to get into the store before my coupon expired, I called ahead and they not only had my shoes waiting for me (because they know my size and preference), but honored the coupon which had been expired for almost a week. WOW me! Thanks so much.

Do not go here. They actually put my inserts in the wrong shoes which were way too big and caused a fall and a torn calf muscle. They will not even repair my phone which broke when I fell and I have doctor bills due to these injuries that I did that not ask a cent for.  They did replace the shoes which were obviously too big.  Terrible customer service.
