I purchased a PreCor 9.33 from Todd P. It arrived in a near by city broken. And it should have arrived  5 months, he has still not repaired it and will not pay to have it repaired. NEVEr do business with them, as they DO NOT stand by their product or  services.

Terrible customer service!  Once they sell you the product they are done!  They said they had to order a part on a $900 bike, a year later, I call the company and they said they had shipped the part out to Fitness Beast.  Fitness Beast, if they will even answer their phone, will NEVER call you back much less come out and fix the equipment.  I'm having to pay another company to come fix a bike that should be under warranty...  Shame on you Fitness Beast.  I don't know how you stay in business.

Nice Website BUT good luck trying to get a hold of someone on the phone! What kind of website shows 24/7 assistance....but wants you to leave a message?  Also, their website shows a showroom in Las Vegas, Guess what? It doesn't exist, fake, nothing. So that leads me to believe its a scam. Buyer Beware.
