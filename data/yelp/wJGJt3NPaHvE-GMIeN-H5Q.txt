This Jack in the Box location saved my buddies and I. twice this past weekend, as it was one of a very few restaurants open after we stumbled out of the Candy Store. I use the term "restaurant" loosely, but we are talking about Phoenix here. It did the trick, and both times the guys working the drive through had all sorts of personality, the second one navigating a ridiculously complicated order and the errant moans from one of my over served friends. The two tacos stand out as one of the great hidden gems on any fast food menu. And at .99$ they're  a bargain to boot!

I have never had a screwed up order here. The staff is really nice and usually will engage in small talk while you wait.  Get the Chicken Club on Sourdough....

Guy in drive thru has Indian accent from hell and they don't carry ranch. This Jack sucks.

One of the better Jack in the Boxes.  They don't overcook their eggs in the morning.

Very friendly service.  Try the breakfast "plate" it is a good deal.
