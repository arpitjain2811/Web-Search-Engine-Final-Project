As a first-time homebuyer, I was worried about the inspection process. Toby took the time to explain everything to me and fielded all of my questions. He provided a thorough and  clear inspection report with photographs. He also made maintenance suggestions and showed me where electrical and water cutoffs were located. Toby can be trusted to do a professional inspection. Debbie S.

We are really happy our Realtor has the contacts she does as we really enjoyed our inspection with Toby. He was very thorough and patient and speaks from a place of experience. He quickly identified areas and was able to speak about the options and alternatives available for mending or repairs. Would do business again.
