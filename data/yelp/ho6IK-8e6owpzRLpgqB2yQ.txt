You know, it's been years since I ate at Burger KIng. I loved this place when I was younger and I can say it certainly contributed to me being as big as a house. I loved their sausage croissants and whoppers, but as I grew older, the whoppers became smaller and of course, more expensive. I think the last time I ate at BK was in Madrid in 2003. Anyway, with coupon in hand I sent the boy to pick up something to nosh on for lunch. I was incited however not by having a 2 for 1 coupon but on the new fries featured in their new commercial. Glad I did. The fries were great They are thicker which I love,  they were hot , maybe a little too much salt. That's it.  The Whopper was delicious and brought me back to my high school days in Passaic NJ where I could put down two of those bad boys. It was hot, fresh and a perfect blend of mayo, mustard and ketchup. As a double whopper is could have been wonderful, but the single was satisfying.  I guess I I have come full circle. I'll be back Mr. Burger King.

Not a bad one. You get what you pay for. The only thing really is the area.

The newley remodeled BK looks great, they lost the stuck in 1998 look. The negatives are the slow customer service, the stupid drink machine ( please bring back the fountains), and the fact that they no longer have cinni-minnis and have replaced them with cinni-bon rolls.
