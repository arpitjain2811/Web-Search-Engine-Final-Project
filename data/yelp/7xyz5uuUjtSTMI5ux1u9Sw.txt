We went in for my brother to get some chest congestion looked at, wait wasent long but all the receptionist could tell us is to see the er....all we needed was the urgent care to call our insurance company so we can get the approval code for a specialist and she wouldn't "since they don't need to" Nice building unfortunate their staff is this unresponsive and lazy.  We will not be coming back again

I waited 2 hours while the front desk clerk was having insurance mix ups. There was only one nurse and one np there seeing patients. The pre exam room where they take your temp & blood pressure is tiny and gross. I will NOT be going there ever again. The only good thing was the np was great.

My daughter went here for a regular exam and check up. They took her card information for payment. They ran the card 3 times, but took the one payment. This incurred $6 worth of fees for the multiple attempts. They then took the money and continue to bill her. We have faxed over the proof of all the attempts and the actual debit. They still continue to bill! Pathetic! They need to get it together.  Why they had to swipe it 3 times when they had their money I have no idea!
