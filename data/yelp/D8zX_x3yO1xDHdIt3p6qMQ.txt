I stopped in this location to redeem a coupon for some free Hemp Hand cream and this store is so vibrant and welcoming, plus they were burning the aromatic oils so the clean fresh smells of citrus beckoned me to linger and look around. This store is doing it right; the sales person was very nice and friendly even though I did not buy and was just there to get my gift. I will return here in the future when I need to stock up on body butter or more hand cream.

I grew up a tomboy. I am lost when it comes to a lot of this girly stuff. Basically, since I have moved to Arizona, my hands have gotten really dry because I am not used to the climate. I knew I needed some sort of heavy duty lotion to solve the problem, but I had no idea where to go or what to get. I walked in here and told the girl my issue and it took her ten seconds to respond with the perfect remedy. I then paid and left. I don't think I spent more than five minutes in the store, total. That's great customer service and the reason I will be back here next time I need something girly that I don't understand.

***CLOSED*** Made the drive to the mall (from my massage in Tempe) specifically to get a few items my Mom loves from TBS, only to find it disappeared.  Went to guest services to inquire about the closing and was told there was a location open at the Paradise Valley mall.
