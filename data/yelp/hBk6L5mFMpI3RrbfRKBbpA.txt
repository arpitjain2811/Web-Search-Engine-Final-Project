I got to give this location "5" stars. Every time I visit I am always greeted the moment I walk through the door. Plus everyone is always so helpful. I stopped by yesterday real quick to grab some shoe insoles. The gentleman who greeted me was very nice. He got me in and out very quick and thanked me for coming in. I am always impressed with this location. By the way this store is always so neat and clean. It sure does "pay more to payless!"

Yes, I agree with Alicia.  I always receive friendly and genuine service at this Payless.  The employees are very kind hearted and seem to enjoy thier jobs.

After shopping at almost every other shoe store in the area, Payless was the only one that had shoes in my daughter's size that 1) fit well 2) she liked and 3) didn't cost me $60 a pair.   They are holding up better than her Stride Rite shoes, too.
