One of the better Home Depot locations, because it is rather quiet and the staff isn't overworked & seem nice.  Staff was polite to give me a few cuts, even a precision cut that was against the official rules.  Huge parking area.

Great Home Depot location. It's usually quiet and not crowded, and there are always people available to help. It's smaller than the Lowe's down the road but prices seem to be a little less. The christmas tree lot here is fantastic - great selection of trees, friendly service, and pretty nicely decorated considering it's a Home Depot.

Always find stuff when I come here. Good choices for everything and the possibilities are endless of trying to narrow down your choices to just one thing. Employees are nice and always ask if you need help.
