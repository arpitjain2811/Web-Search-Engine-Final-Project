Burton is a stand-alone fingerprinting and passport photo business. They are located next to the immigration office on Pecos just off Sunset.  The office is small, but the staff working handles the job of fingerprinting and photos quite well.  I would definitely recommend their services, although, I advise they are about $5 higher than Walgreens on your passport photos

Went here to get my fingerprint done for a new job. The older man working there was extremely rude to me. It's my first time dealing with this so I wasn't sure what to say, he didn't have patience with me. There was a lady in front of me who he was nice to, he even made small talk with her. I'm not sure what the difference was. When it was my turn to go up and pay, he threw my card back at me. I walked in with a smile, so it's not like I had attitude first. I'll be sure to go somewhere else for my passport and fingerprint needs.

Went to another fingerprint place and was greeted with very rude service. And they couldn't process my fingerprints electronically for the board of nursing. Was told to come here and I'm glad I did. The lady was very nice and helpful. Esp with getting the actual fingerprints. (I have the hardest time with that machine) She made my life easier. I completely recommend this place. They get the job done properly!!
