For being a DUMP, should expect much more. Flys, stink, garbage, dirt, and everything that comes with. Salt River... Keepin it real dumpy!

Salt River landfill is pretty nice as far as dumps go.  I have been going to landfills and green waste dumps for over 10 years . Their prices is about average and they are about average for time in and time out.   The only major negative things I can say is they have pretty high requirements to set up a commercial account and they only accept cash.
