Tried Atlanta Bread Company for the first (and last) time this week.  Food was very mediocre.  Fillings of sandwiches were fine, but the bread tasted stale.  To be named "Atlanta BREAD Company" and not have bread that knocks your socks off is ridiculous.  Not to mention the unfriendly manager and a front door that wouldn't open properly.  Overall, not a good experience.

I sort of agree with last reviewer But I didn't have any rude manager to deal with.  Not much  of a selection for a place that has bread in their name.  It reminded me of Panera Bread, but with less selection.  I went for breakfast.  The Coffee that was in the HOT pots was cold.   Free WiFi YEAH!!
