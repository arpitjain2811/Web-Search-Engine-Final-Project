I have eaten at Maxes MANY time. They have spectacular breakfast and awesome lunches. I have claimed them to have the best grilled cheese I have ever had. Sorry mom. . .  Chris T. and I went there for lunch today and he tried the grilled cheese with bacon and tomato. Chris said it was almost a 4 start grilled cheese. I was going to go with the Ruben just out of habit but I ordered his "Coyote Big Max:" instead. Although it was a very good burger I just was a little disappointed in it. I have had much better from this place.  This is a nice little Deli in the office complex where I work. A tab bit pricey for my taste but other people say it isn't that bad.

Similar to what Pierre said, this place was about 2 minutes from my office. Unfortunately, this place is no more.  The owner passed away and it is now some sort of Deli. Maybe I'll eat there and review it. It had great food. It had great service. R.I.P. Coyote Cafe... R.I.P...
