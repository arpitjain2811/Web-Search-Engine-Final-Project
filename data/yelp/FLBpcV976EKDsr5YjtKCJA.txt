I've taken my puppy to K9 Day Out for Daycare and for boarding and they've definately taken great care of him!  He's always thrilled to see Danielle when I drop him off and he comes home tuckered and in a great mood.  It's also great to see pictures of him having fun while I'm away.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!  Danielle and her family are very caring and personable.  We know that Bogey is in a safe and loving environment when he visits K9 Day Out.
