Great local spot around Chandler. Food has always been fantastic and my ice cold glass of Kiltlifter ever full.  The owners are great people to chill and converse with or just come in and play some pool. This place has a great atmosphere and surprisingly a delicious bowl of Pho.  Highly recommended.

Oh I also forgot to add that when they brought out my husbands can of Guiness they said oh sorry we have no clean glasses... Really? Really unorganized and not a place I will ever return to!!

Great place to have a nice meal.  Food is fusion Vietnamese cuisine meets great pub atmosphere.  The pho is good but my favorite are the spring rolls - I get the tofu, but you can get animal protein too. Cold beer and good food with family and/or friends makes this an easy recommend.
