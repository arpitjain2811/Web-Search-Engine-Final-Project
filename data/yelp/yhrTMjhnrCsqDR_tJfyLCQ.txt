Located around the corner from Highland Falls Golf Course, I like to stop by this location to grab a quick bite before a round of golf.  I really like the Sausage Biscuit Sandwich here.  They always get my order right and are fast.  I don't ask for much from my fast food restaurants....ha! Will I return?  As long as I'm golfing, there's a good chance.

This location is no longer in business. It has been closed for several months. I'm a little surprised they closed, as every time I was there they had customers, the majority of whom were seniors from Sun City. Granted I was there at breakfast/lunch time, I have no idea how busy they were at night.
