Yes, they are open.  And yes, they know how to cut hair properly and not irritate you with a bad haircut.   I am fond that they actually listen to you and seem to care about what you are saying.  I have dealt with too many that just blow me off and do what THEY want to do... and these guys aren't like that. I have also heard they carry ammonia free hair dye... so pregnant women... you can get your hair dyed here. :)

Loved my haircut. Walked in and waited for just a minute. The stylist cut exactly like I wanted and I walked out paying 20 which included the tip.
