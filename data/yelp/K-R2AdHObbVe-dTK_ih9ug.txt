This place has lousy service, even by K-Mart's low standards.  It's bad enough that they're in a sketchy neighborhood, with clientele to match, but the service is virtually non-existent.

I love k-mart they have the rewards program which is always giving me gextra bucks..the guys in electronics are always helpful. You can get a car wash in the parking lot. and be prepared to stand in line for at least 5 minutes

This store could use a cleaning  both inside and out. They have workers browsing the aisles flapping their gums while the lines are allowed to grow longer and longer. A million cashiers, a million customers in line waiting to checkout...but only 2 lanes open? WTH!?!?!  The only plus is the friendly guy who greets you at the door.
