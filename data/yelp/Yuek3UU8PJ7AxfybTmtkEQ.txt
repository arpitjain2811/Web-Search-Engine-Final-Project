Brand new location! Very clean and organized w friendly staff! In true 99 cent only fashion, they carry everything you could possibly be looking for in a dollar store. Picked up some butterfly shaped silicone ice cube trays!  :-)

OMG!!! A Ninety-Nine Cent Only store that's NOT in a ghetto, is actually clean and organized, and the staff was friendly and helpful? The end of the world must be near! I know it's brand new, but I do hope they stay the way they are, because no other 99 Cent store even comes close in comparison this one!

I love this place and you will too! I like their produce and always check there first before going to another grocery store. The cards are great. The store is clean and spacious. The people who work there are helpful and very cheerful. Its a great place with always a few surprises in store!
