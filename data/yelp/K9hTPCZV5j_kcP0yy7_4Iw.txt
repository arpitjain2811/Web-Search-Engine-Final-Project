My last few experiences here have been horrible. I had been coming here since I was a kid, not only myself but my whole family, and boy have they changed for the worse. They took a wrong tooth out of my mother's mouth!  Never again. We definitely found a new dentist.

I have been going to this office for many years. The staff is always personable and the office is very clean.

Very friendly people work here, the wait was only 10 minutes even though 4 people were called before me, the tooth extraction was very quick and painless, and Dr. Hammond took care of me like family :)

I have been going to Hurst since 1989. I've even changed locations with them. These people are the best. ALWAYS friendly, on time and accurate. And if you have an emergency they fit you in . I want to give a special shout out to Rachel ( she's the woman who takes your money) could not ask for a better staff.

I love my dentist!!! Not only are they so nice and friendly every visit, but they give me so many options and explain everything in terms even I can understand. They make one of the most grueling things (going to the dentist) actually fun and enjoyable. See you guys in 6 months!!
