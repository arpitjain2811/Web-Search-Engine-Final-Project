We use to go to the Walgreens on 107 and McDowell Rd. The CVS is a little our of our way but worth the drive. The Pharmacy staff is always so wonderful and every one of them make sure to say hello  to us by our names (except the newbies of course but they get it eventually).  Recently we have been going through a lot with my 13 year old son. Tracy, a pharmacist has really gone out of her way to help us understand what is going on with the medications and it illness, more so then the doctors have. I think without her I would still be lost.  Thank you all for being so great and taking the time out of your busy days to even say hello.  Sheri B
