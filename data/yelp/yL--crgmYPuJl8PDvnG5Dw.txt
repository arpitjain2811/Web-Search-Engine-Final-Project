The service was very friendly, fast service the place wasn't too packed as I stopped by around 11am. The pupusas were somewhat thin and lacking cheese opposed to others I've eaten.

Bad Service. Bad Food. My boyfriend ordered a kolashampan and they were flat. Ugly interior with a sign that says Welcome To Gringo's. I ordered the plantains with cream and beans. These were the most watered down beans I ever had. Horrible. My boyfriend's egg had runny oil. Ugh. I wish I had a warning.
