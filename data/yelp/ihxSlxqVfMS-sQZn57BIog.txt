This Little Caesars is GREAT! Service is very friendly and they offer a wide range of specialty Hot-N-Ready items.  E.G. Supreme, 3 Meat Treat, Hawaiian, Sausage, Wings and Italian Cheesebread. They keep all of these Hot-N-Ready 4-8pm so you don't have to wait!

Ok here is the deal $5.00 pizza you get what you pay for right? For a dollar more order the new thin crust pizza. I do not know what happen? It was really,really good just a few months ago they started to change the recipe or something. It use to be a thin cracker like pizza dough, but now I am no longer having it. Now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place. I would get Red Barron frozen before I were to get this again. I am sorry but it use to be good.

It's Little Caesar's...what more can you say. Cheap, consistent pizza, great for feeding large groups. They are pushing the deep dish lately, but 60% more money for a little more crust, please. For $8-11, you can find a lot better pizza. Friendly staff keeps it a go-to.
