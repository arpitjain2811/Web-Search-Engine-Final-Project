The worst experience! Was referred to Dr. bond by fellow expats, but instead of the expected warmth, I was treated like a poor parent who "didn't go somewhere else because didn't know english", well, I DO!!! Each time we went for visits, a different doctor would see us, having to explain to each one particularities and so on... Always 'reasuring'us everything is fine,never really being receptive about my slightest concerns.  Most of the staff is unfriendly and uninformed! Definetely not recommending him to anyone and in the process of moving to a different doctor!
