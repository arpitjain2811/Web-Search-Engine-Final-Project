I was at a wedding here and it was very nice.

The complimentary airport shuttle service that I booked more than 24 hours in advance per their request was never sent to pick me up. Our room was never cleaned - even though we were gone 8am until midnight. One of the staff members verbally abused my friend throughout the night. A long, odd and uncomfortable story. The manager never bothered to return the message I left her highlighting these issues. Yikes!

Pool was dirty and disgusting. Too bad since the rest seemed nice
