Awesomeness. He runs his tailoring business out of the backroom of his very nice house. I love him. He makes my super fancy jeans look great, even though I'm 5'4", and he will reattach the original bottoms if requested.

I had Cameron tailor 2 LBM 1911 jackets and he did an outstanding job. Cameron is incredibly friendly and has a true appreciation and respect for quality clothing. He also is capable of making custom suiting and shirting at reasonable prices. If you bring him your best fitting shirt/suit/pants he can replicate the fit and use whatever materials you want. I did notice some of his shirting fabric samples and they included Thomas Mason. Highly recommended!

Great service, perfect quality, fast, and hassle-free.  This is the place I trust to alter my clothes. Sometimes he does work while I wait and watch TV, which compared to most tailors, is lightning-fast.
