Ok, here's the thing.....I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio eating Polish, German and Slovenian meat & sausage.  Best places back home to buy this kind of thing are on 185th Street, the ethnic "hood."   Moving to Phoenix meant lots of sunshine, no snow and no sausage like I was used to.  The closest I could find to home was Stanley's on Bell Road.  They have a wonderful selection and the girls smile every time I go in and ask, "Now how do you pronounce that?"  My favorite is the rice sausage that's made with liver.  It is in a ring and bakes up great in the oven!  Short of making a trip back to Cleveland & 185th Street or the West Side Market, this is GOOD STUFF!   Do I shop there all the time?  Nope, but it's definitely the place to go to stock up for ethnic holiday types of meals, especially at Easter and Christmas time.   I stopped at Shreiner's last week on my way home from work and was a little dissappointed.  They were out of a lot of stuff, didn't even seem familiar with my favorites, but the young girl working there was very nice.  She told me they don't make the type of sausage I was looking for, but suggested I try some Brats.   Not exactly what I wanted, but I decided to try some. They were okay, but for the really good, authentic ethnic sausage I love, I'll keep going to Stanley's!

Stanley's on Bell road has been evicted. Drove out the weekend after turkey day and it is no longer open.
