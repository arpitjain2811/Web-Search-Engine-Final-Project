I have minimal expectations for this chain and they have been met. I have had to return to the restaurant many times after leaving the drive through to get my order fixed.  That would have to be my biggest complaint. On a positive note, the inside and outside of the building  is normally clean and tidy. They have always gotten my food out fast, which normally would be a plus if I didn't have to go back to get the order fixed. This location has a prime location due to the fact they have no competing venues with in miles of them.

Only been here once. Had a small order so there should have not been any problems. Place is very clean, and kept up. Crew was very nice.

I like this location. Never had an issue. The staff are young but have always been pleasant. The food has always been good and the place is clean as a taco bell can be. :)

Not bad for Taco Bell pretty fast.  Its probably the fastest drive thru in town when you in a rush. They even ran me down when they forgot to put my Empanada in the bag. The prices just need to go down on some items.
