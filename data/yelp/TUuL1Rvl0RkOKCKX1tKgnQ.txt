They have a variety of nice boats that are well maintained and fairly new.  Lots of extras available like tubes and wakeboards.

What a great experience!!! Wild Burro's, crazy cactus, awesome rock formations and a amazing tour guide.  We recommend the late tour to see the amazing sunset.  All this seen from a boat.  This is a must to do, well worth every penny.
