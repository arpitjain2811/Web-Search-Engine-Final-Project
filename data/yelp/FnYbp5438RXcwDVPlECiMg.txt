Wow!  Jennifer does amazing color!!!! My hair is impossible to color, the color never stay's so it seemed like it was always a waist of money! . Jen said "give me a shot. .. you'll be happy!" THAT was an understatement! My hair is amazing! ! Thanks Jen!! I send everyone I know to you!

Originally created a yelp account so I could put a crappy business on blast but I love my nail tech so much I had to sing her praises. Here we go: since the first time I had my nails done by Lauren, I haven't gone to anyone else. She is a creative genius, through and through. I hardly give Lauren any direction and she runs wild with beautiful and festive creations for both acrylics and gels. It just doesn't get any better. I highly recommend Lauren for all of your nail needs!!

Jennifer does wonderful color and cuts.  I just wish I could take her with me to blow dry my hair.  She does excellent work!
