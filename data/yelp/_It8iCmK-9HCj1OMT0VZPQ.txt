Love this company.  Fred, the owner is a true professional.  These guys know what they are doing.  I would trust them with any sort of leather no matter the uniqueness of the piece or the severity of the damage. Keep it up guys!

I hired Leather Like New to reupholstered a chair. The back cushion in cowhide and the seat in leather. The leather seat turned out fine, however the cowhide has a severe crease from the top to bottom. First of all, I don't understand why Fred did not choose a better piece of cowhide and secondly, when I brought this to his attention he said he couldn't do anything about it. He stated it may soften with time or it may not. Very disappointed that he was unwilling to take a look at it or try to remedy the situation. The chair looks unprofessional and people have commented on the imperfection. Would not recommend.

I had a high end sofa and love that had seen better days. They were still very comfortable, so I thought I'd have them cleaned and conditioned. The company that came over to clean them said they were beyond repair. Leather Like New was recommended and both pieces now look good as new...I kid you not. It's unbelievable what they did to each piece. Thanks guys for an amazing and incredible job.
