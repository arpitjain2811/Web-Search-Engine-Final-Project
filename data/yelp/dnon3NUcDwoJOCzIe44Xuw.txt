Great hot wings and burgers with fries. Orders may be slow somtimes but its worth the wait. Great Juke-Box, Kareoke Night on Fridays and Saturdays, you can play pool and play darts in the back. the atmosphere is very fun and lively I had a great time when I was visiting and I will surelly be back when I have the chance.

Met up with a friend here to have some drinks. The crowd was very sketchy. Lots of bikers and hoodlums. Was a hold on tight to your wallet tight type of place. Although I hear they have very good wings. Might have to hire a body guard and go check them out.

The only reason they get 1 star is because the wings. This is the most nasty, disgusting and rude place you can sit down n eat. The ppl who horse bet has no respect for other customers. The Russian waitress is a true b****. She rubs me as a racist. The old bar tender finger nails are filthy.  He rubs me as a meth head. The old white lady is for sure a meth addict. PPL SAY NO TO DRUGS N PURPLE TURTLE
