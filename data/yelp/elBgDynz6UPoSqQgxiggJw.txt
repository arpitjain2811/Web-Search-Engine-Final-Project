I came here following a student. On trial basis. It's kind a small place but very calming....havnt figured out why yet.  You feel spoiled here. I only get my hair done here but planning to use other services soon. I noticed that other clients as well get great personal services here. It's nice to see men come here as well.

Tracy gives the best massages - deep tissue.  She is hard to get an appointment with because she is so good.  But it is definitely worth the effort to get in.  If I could afford it, I would get a massage from Tracy every week!

Jen Reid is an awesome stylist!  She does such a great job with my color and is the "brow-whisperer".
