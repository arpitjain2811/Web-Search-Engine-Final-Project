There are many furniture stores in Casa Grande but this one is by far the best. It is locally owned and operated unlike the other big box stores. I prefer to shop locally and gave this place a try. They have a great selection and can even custom order for you. If it's not in the store they can find it. Great prices and great people. Shop here first!!

After moving here from the East Coast we were starting fresh on furniture.  This little store was quite a surprise.  Service was top notch, prices more then fair and the staff had true knowledge and were willing to special order without fees of anything they did not have in stock.  Forget the big box stores.  True small town service with a large selection of goods.  We have been back numerous times.

I love this store! Awesome staff and they are able to order anything I need. Delivery fees are super cheap and furniture is great quality! What a hidden gem!
