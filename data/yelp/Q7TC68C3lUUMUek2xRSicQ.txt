Extremely bad repairs! Do not take your car there.  I am in the process of suing them.  BAD, BAD, BAD!

Good work done by Ryan & Chapo! My G37 Sound even better after their custom exhaust installed. A+

I went here because my car was just shaking and blowing smoke. I was told before that it was a cylinder ring and this was going to cost out of pocket $1000. When i went there i was greeted by the owner Ryan and his mechanic (didn't catch his name). They stayed over their business hours and were trouble shooting it to figure out what happened. Well, thankfully they found the issue and it was my fuel injector. After they replaced it and charged labor, it was like a big stress relief! THANK YOU GUYS! Seriously, i was able to drive my car home and it was no longer shaking and smoking. I will gladly recommend this shop. Thank you!

Professional, knowledgable staff. Excellent advice. Great prices. Good people. Win. Experience: 2013 V6 ford mustang that sounds like a beast, thanks to Ryan and his crew.
