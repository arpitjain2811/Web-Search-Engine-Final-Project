I always have excellent results with Sue!    In fact, I trust no one else with my Botox!!  Sue is extremely knowledgeable and and experienced.  She goes out of her way for her clients and is professional, yet down-to-earth.   I would definitely recommend her to others.

Sue is amazing. She is very down to earth , easy to talk to , attentive and understanding. I have been seeing her for over three years. Not only is she skilled but her prices are amazing! For the level of service you get you would normally pay a lot more. Not only does sue know what she is doing but you really get your money's worth!!!!!
