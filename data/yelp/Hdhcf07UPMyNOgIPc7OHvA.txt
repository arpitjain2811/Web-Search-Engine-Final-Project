Needed to get a adapter to hook up my portable air conditioner. Mike was very knowledgeable and friendly. It was a special order part, so I needed to be helped by Shannon. She was excellent at her job, knew exactly want I was looking for and let me know what was happening every step of the way. Very pleased with the process.
