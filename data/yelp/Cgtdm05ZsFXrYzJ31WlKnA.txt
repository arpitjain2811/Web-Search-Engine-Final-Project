If you go here, I recommend paying cash, but if you must use plastic, especially debit, watch the transaction closely and definitely get your receipts. Also, check your statements if you often patronize the place. If you are not careful this character will bill you double.

I'm not sure how this place stays open as it's always empty. The lounge is ok but not very atmospheric. The prices are decent if on a budget. Otherwise, go elsewhere.

I seriously made a Yelp profile just because I wanted to warn people about this place! They are totally over priced, which probably has something to do with the sneaky employees. I'm pretty sure they make up their own prices as they go along. Not one time, have I ever paid the same amount & I've always purchased the same two things!! I probably wouldn't mind paying more if I had a good time when I went in there but their attitudes are just as bad as the prices! Save your $ and go somewhere that appreciates your business.

Rude service last time I was in to get flavor and coals "what you want"- besides them having a poor selection of flavor they also had nothing but a junk selection of coals! Only stopped here because it's open late compared to most "smoke shops" on this side of town. If it's the day time, drive up the street in the walmart parking lot - Mo's is much better!
