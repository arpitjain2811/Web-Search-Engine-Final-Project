Nice people friendly atmosphere. They did a very nice job on my nails and the spa pedicure with callus remover and sugar scrub had a beautiful result. They have many styles of hand painted artwork and jewels for nails. Reasonably priced.

Very friendly, relaxed salon. Great value and artwork from these ladies. They're always willing to please the client. The prices cant be beat in the area and theres hardly ever a wait. I get my pedis on a regular basis here and have been pleased with the eyebrow waxes too.

Worse $15 I have ever spent.   A joke of a pedicure. Little to no massage and the buffing of my feet was terrible.  They might be worse now.  Save your $15 for the delicious sushi next store.

Pedicure was ok .. Don't waste the money on the leg message could even tell she was touching me.. Pretty weak effort on her part reflected in her Tip!
