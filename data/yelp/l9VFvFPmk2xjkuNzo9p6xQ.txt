It's strange to dread getting gas at a certain gas station.  But I think this gas station has managed it.  When you swipe your credit card, you have to wait while the gas pump spews out advertisements for some credit card.  Then, when you finally get to pump gas, the gas pump screams out audio about a rewards program.   Personally, I would never join a rewards program for gas.  I get gas when my car is out of gas.  I would never go out of my way to get gas at a particular gas station just because it has a rewards program.  Same with convenience store items.  The only time I sought out a certain gas station was when I was 16 and my dad gave me his Shell credit card.  Now that's a rewards program... gas I don't have to pay for.  Unless the gas is free, a rewards program is just one more annoying card I have to carry around.  And I have to waste time and sanity trying to get to that particular gas station, not even to mention the possibility of running out of gas. This location does get an extra star for having a post office, which is useful because the Summerlin post office is always packed for some reason.  And it has a self-serve car wash that will do a passable job cleaning your car. But other than that, I cannot recommend City Stop #5.

Please note that this City Stop is turning into a 7-11 and the gas will now be Sinclair. If you have a City Stop rewards card it will no longer be valid.
