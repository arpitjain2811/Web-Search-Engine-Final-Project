$40 dollars plus tax for a oil change?? I think not. Drove less than half a mile down the road got it done 19.99 plus tax. Wont be returning and will be recommending people to stay away.

Good job guys! 5 star service. In and out under an hour! Reasonable pricing. Change the oil and flushed the transmission on my company's van. Special thanks to Peter & Scott. They was polite, and honest. The shop looked very clean. That tells a lot about a mechanical automotive shop.
