I agree the bread sticks are the best. The pizza is good for $5.00

the price is unbeatable as mentioned earlier. $5 for a hot and ready one topping pizza. They are consistently good, their dough is the best in our town. Plus it's always convenient.

How can you complain about a $5.00 pizza.

Great price (duh) and they are super fast. I've never waited longer than 5 minutes to get in and grab some food. Nice folks behind the counter, too.

Typical little caesars but it's hot and ready and close to me so great when you feel lazy. I'm glad they brought back the pan style pizza.

Let's be realistic. Anytime you go to an establishment that is ran by teenagers and you don't receive attitude, it's a win. The pizza is always the same, cheap but tolerable. I would recommend buying a dipping sauce or even a marinara sauce to go along with your pizza because if you don't it is pretty dry.
