Worst Pharmacy Experience in 30 years!  Paul, the pharmacist hates his job and was very unprofessional.  At one point he had a customer banging on the drive thru window because of their frustration.  I will never set foot in this Walgreens again.  Horrible experience.

great store. always clean, so are the bathrooms. employees can be rude but thats on a rare occasion. always go here for little last minute errans. close by my house so thats also awesome.

Terrible prices at this Pharmacy. They quoted me a price 5x higher than I pay at a large, national, well-known superstore chain.  And this on a drug that is generic and old as the hills.  AWFUL!
