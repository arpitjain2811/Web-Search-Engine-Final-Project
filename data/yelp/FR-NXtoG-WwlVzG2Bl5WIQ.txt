Manager seems to work the front register and she does an amazing job!  I'm sick and tired of having my rather simple order screwed up, or have to endure a cashier who cannot enter just one modification to a meal item. This place is clean too, always, and especially breakfast hours.  This location has pancakes too, which is nice.  There's also the play area for kids.  Parking is decent.  What's not to like?

Great service & food with the best part being the place was nearly spotless!
