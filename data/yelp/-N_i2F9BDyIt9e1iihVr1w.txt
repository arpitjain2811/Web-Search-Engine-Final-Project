Had the lunch special (fish, shrimp, hush puppies, sides).  Fried catfish was finely breaded, tasty and not too greasy.  Macaroni salad and coleslaw definitely homemade with a nice light flavor and texture, a good balance to the fried meal.  Loved the hole-in-the-wall, family-run feel.

Lunch specials for $5.95! 3pc fish, 3pc shrimp, 2 hush puppies AND 2 side orders. This all seafood restaurant is my pescetarian dream come true. They offer snapper, catfish, tilapia, trout, buffalo, whiting shrimp, and even oysters. Great food at great prices. Not open Sundays.

Okay lunch special.   Get what you pay for.  Too much breading, hush puppies were a bit tiny, salads were soso
