Hands down the best dispensary in my area (Gilbert, AZ). I have tried other places, but this place always has me coming back. The atmosphere and service is awesome. I am usually in and out fairly quickly. All of their meds are high quality and have fair prices, including their strain of the week! The staff here are extremely helpful and welcoming. It might be hard at first to locate the place, but it's easily accessible. I recommend this place if you're looking for a professional and welcoming atmosphere. Thank you H4L!
