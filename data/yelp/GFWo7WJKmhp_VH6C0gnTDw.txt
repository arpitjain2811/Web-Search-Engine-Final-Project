There are quite a few gas station around where I live. Many have the same prices, but I always get my gas at this station.  The place is always spotless. The restrooms are clean and not grungy. The people working here are efficient, friendly.  The drinks aren't as cheap as Circle K, but I prefer to reuse my cup instead of throw styrofoam away.  I guess the only downside is there tend to be cops there frequently at night, this might not be great for everyone. The cops aren't there because of trouble, but they get stuff from this store.  Personally, I think this recommends this station.
