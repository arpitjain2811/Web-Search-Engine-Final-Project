Preety threading Is the place where I get my eyebrows done in perfect shape. Every one is nice and well experienced which means they take care of you the best. I suggest people this place. And also suggest people for eyelash extensions as well cheap only $25.00. Preety threading is fully licensed and best price offers in valley. Great job Preety threading

I have the best experience ever about my eyebrows. They are so nicely .. I didn't even feel that somebody shaped them with thread .. She was perfect and smooth doing my eyebrows and suggested me what looks better on me. I will recommend all my friend list and families to Preety threading

I live 1 hour away from this place i gladly drive 1 hour for an 8$ thread. Because it is so worth it. Reeta does it perfect! !   I have never gotten a better brow job than here.
