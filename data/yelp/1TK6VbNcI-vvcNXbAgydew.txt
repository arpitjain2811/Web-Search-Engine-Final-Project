Came in for the second time. Clothes are pretty awful but I needed candles and with the recession I have to search high and low. The clerks are very rude , no eye contact, hello, goodbye or thank you. Loud personal conversations are going on in every department. I should work here. It is basically clock in then stand around and talk for 8 hours. The store is dark the mercy is very bad. The whole place smells like cheap glue. Poor lighting. You really feel like your at the salvation army

Went here for the first time yesterday.  Although it is clean and there was an okay selection,  I don't think I'll be back due to the extreme stink eye the loss prevention guy was giving me the entire time.   I was with my two kids, who were a little on the obnoxious side.  However they were not screaming and running. They were playing in the aisles,  looking at the toys and fighting over things..... As 7 and 3 year old sisters tend to do.   I'm pretty sure he followed me around for the last half of my time there and as I waited in line and mu kids wandered through the accessories, daggers were shooting out his eyes. I kind of felt like he thought we were going to rob him and wreck the place.  I found a couple pairs of shoes for my youngest that I promised her I'd buy. Or I would have left without spending any money there.   Pretty sure I'll only go back there if I have to.

This Ross store always looks like a tornado hit it.  Beside low stock there are always items all over the floor. I never see staff picking things up to rehang them.  I would suggest going to another Ross location.
