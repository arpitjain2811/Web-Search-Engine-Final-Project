This place is like a zoo just run by animals literally I stayed waiting in line for 10 minutes and there was a couple a head of me waiting there for an extra 5 minutes and I said you know what I'm out of here I'm going to Carls Jr.

Can't screw up the food as I got a basic hamburger. The service though sucks big time here.. If you go thru drive thru expect a 10 minute wait minimum. If it's busy it will be longer
