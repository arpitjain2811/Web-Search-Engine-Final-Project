I came here a couple of weeks ago and instead of skipping over their Weight Watchers menu I actually tried something on it. They had two salads on there that sounded interesting one had fruit in it and the other one had steak and potatoes. I tried the one with steak and potatoes of course! It was different but it felt like a whole meal and it was good! The salad also had fresh spinach and finished off by a tasty vinaigrette that I wouldn't mind having again!

My friends and I came here a couple of nights ago. We had a great time and all the food came out right. Heather was a GREAT server! She had a great personality the entire time.

Kudos to Applebee's for opening early for breakfast to raise money for the families of the two Metro Police Officers and a citizen recently killed in Las Vegas. Breakfast was very good, the service was excellent and thank you for being a Community Partner. All funds raised will be donated.

Food was pretty good. Service great. We like this Applebee's location better than others in town.
