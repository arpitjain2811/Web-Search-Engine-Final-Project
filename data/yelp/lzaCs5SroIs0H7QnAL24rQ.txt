I had never been to an Arizona Blimpie, so I dropped in here this morning a little after 11 to see wuzup. This is a good-sized place, seating about 60.  There weren't any booths, but the table seating & the dining room overall were comfortable & pleasant, with the place getting rather busy by 11:20. I ordered a 12" Hot Pastrami on Whole Wheat ($8.09).  It came with slices of Swiss Cheese onboard & the open face may have been dipped just quickly, at least on one side. This place is no Capriotti's, but my sub and the service were both "A-OK".     :-) Open Monday through Friday.
