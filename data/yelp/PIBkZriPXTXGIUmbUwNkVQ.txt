We Love DDPS!!! Great teachers and owners, supportive parents, impressive creative projects, and fun events for the kiddos (especially pizza day, bubbles the clown, and zoo day)! My mini me is prepared for kindergarten and is a balanced child thanks to the love, care, mentorship, and creativity from Desert Dawn! We have been here for over two years and wish we started sooner.
