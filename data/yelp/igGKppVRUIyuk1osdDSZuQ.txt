The name is fitting because that's what practically covered the joint. This place was empty when I visited. I got tumbleweed stuck in my hair. We had to invent people to talk too! Not the staff's fault, they seemed very nice. Just not a popular place anymore.

Back in the day, The Spider's Web was the place to be seen for a particular type of Edinburgh gentleman. It's typical punter was permanently on disability benefit, had a severe alcohol problem, and would often spend 12 hours a day in here, drinkling heavily and soiling himself, in order to escape from his battleaxe of a wife. In turn, she'd spend most of her days chain smoking and having unprotected, disesase ridden sex with various men she met down the Jobcentre. It also had a cult following amongst nightclub revellers whom were just a bit too keen to stay up all night and damage their internal organs further. Sadly, both customer bases seem a bit thin on the ground  these days, but fingers crossed it can ride out the storm and return to glories past.

Not the coolest of places... but my goodness! are the pints of 80/ here so good! Also the Beatles memorabilia are pretty impressive.  Friendly too. Save me having to trek down to Diggers for a damn good pint.
