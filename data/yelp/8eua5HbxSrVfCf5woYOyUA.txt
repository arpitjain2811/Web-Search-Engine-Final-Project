Love Arby's. However a medium curly fries is allegedly 600(!) calories. So worth it though. 1 star off for their shakes being mediocre. They always seem to be pretty thin.

Damn You Chicken Tenders for being so tasty!

Excellent sandwiches even without sauce.. service has always been friendly and when the order came out wrong recently, I was handed the correct order with a sincere apology. Fast food restaurants rarely have staff who care enough to even offer an insincere apology, much less one that is sincere.. kudos!
