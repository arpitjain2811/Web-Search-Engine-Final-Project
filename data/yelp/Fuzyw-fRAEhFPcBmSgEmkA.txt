Great little hardware store! Doesn't hurt that all the guys that work there are super hot, either!

My brother just moved into the neighborhood and we love Dorn's! For a small store they seem to have whatever we need, and they are so so helpful!

Dorn is the quintessential neighborhood hardware store. The staff is super helpful and when I moved I was there almost every day to pick up something I needed for the house. They have everything from small screws for hanging pictures to steam vacuums you can rent. The store may look small but they somehow still have everything I need. It is also a lot easier, friendlier and less time consuming to go to Dorn vs. going to a big box store.
