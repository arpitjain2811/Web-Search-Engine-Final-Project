Great place. I really liked the pedi. Average, yes, but a good value.

I'm a fan! I've been coming to Pink Gelish Nails since they opened, literally. They had been opened 24 hours when I went in for my first spa mani/pedi. Arizona is tough on feet and Kristine did a great job on my calluses, making my feet beautifully soft again. I did a French mani/pedi the first time that lasted 3 weeks easily. Each time I go back, Kristine has done something completely different for each of the holidays. I'm always asked where I get my nails done. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!

This is the worst nail salon I've ever been to.  The techs are amateur and the male tech that did my pedicure was so lame, by day 2 after my pedi my toes looked awful!  I don't recommend this place at all!
