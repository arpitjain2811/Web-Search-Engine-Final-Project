Real good! Real cheap! The dentist took his time to explain my treatment options. His staff is super nice and the office clean. I've been coming to him for over 9 years now and have had no problems so far. Highly recommended.

I has some major dental work done by this dentist.  My crowns are cracking, my bridge work is too small, very bad customer service, poor book keeping, and over all just not a good dentist.  I was very disappointed in my dental work, and told him.  The sad thing is he would not resolve my issues.  I had to take my issues and concerns to the Dental Board.

I came back over 15 years later to express how impressed I am with my front crown. I have had several compliments from other dentists and hygienists.  Priceless! Thanks Dr. Crow!
