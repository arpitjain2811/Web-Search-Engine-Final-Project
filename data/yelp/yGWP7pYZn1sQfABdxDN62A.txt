If I could give Cooper 6 stars, I would.  After dealing with some unprofessional A/C companies in PHX, Cooper's professionalism, excellent service and timeliness was a VERY welcomed surprise. They came out to service both of our units for our business and were amazing.  The tech actually showed up early (when does that ever happen??) and then went above and beyond to get our unit working like it should be.  To top it all off, they were very reasonably priced which just made the experience even better. Thanks again for all your help! I would highly recommend the Cooper team to anyone looking for a honest and reliable company in the Valley.

What an amazing company! It is actually hard to find a great A/C company that you can trust and rely on, especially during the hot summer months when all the A/C companies are so busy. I felt like I was a priority to them. They came out, did a 6 hour inspection, and told me exactly what was wrong with my unit, they also gave me a timeframe on fixing and and really went above and beyond to ensure the job was done correctly. They came out at 7pm to fix the unit to ensure to was completed the day they committed it would be. That is service!  Who comes to your home and works that late in the evening and doesn't charge extra for it? These guys! I highly recommend them!, their price is just right, and their customer service and knowledge are over the top!
