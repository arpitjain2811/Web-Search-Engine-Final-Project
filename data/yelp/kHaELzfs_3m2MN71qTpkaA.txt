This is the place to go if you're a Seattle Seahawks fan.  We were there in the summer and there wasn't an open seat in the whole place though it was a rather large restaurant/bar.  We order the nachos which were less than desired. They did have some pitcher specials on Pyramid.  It was nice to have a good Seattle beer available away from home & the price wasn't bad at all.  I give this place this rating for it's beer selection & pro-Seahawks environment.  Other than that, it was just mediocre.

Really? $9 pitcher is the happy hour special and it is domestic beer only? Even with no smokers around this place smelled like a Denny's of yesteryear when everyone smoked.  Food was nothing to get excited about yet the prices show that they think they are.   What a dissapointment.  Should have heeded caution of other yelp review.

Probably one of the worst bars I have been to in Las Vegas. Smokey, high prices for shitty food and really bad service. I came here for the first game of the NFL season last year to follow the Seahawks. They only had 2 people at the bar and they seemed to hate that is way busy so they were very unhelpful and the only thing the place was stressed out about was not clogging the video poker that nobody was playing at the bar. After spending $40 on beer and food I decided I would just buy the Sunday ticket instead on direct TV. Also the TVs were extremely dated projection Box TV that were super distorted.
