I see Maria twice a month for facials and would highly recommend her services to anyone looking to either pamper themselves or have skin concerns corrected.  Maria uses natural products that leave my skin looking and feeling amazing.

I have had massages in the past and Maria has out done them all. She is very professional and respects your wishes. She does what is best for her clients while making them feel very comfortable. The room is cozy with just the right amount of lighting with soothing spa music. I highly recommend Melt Massage & Facial Studio. Maria's massages are the best. Can't wait to go back.

The facial that I had with Maria was great. The room was cozy with great lighting & mood music. I have really sensitive skin & Maria really listened to my concerns. I recommend Maria & will definitely go back!

I had a massage with Maria yesterday and feel better than I have felt in months!  I was beginning to despair that I was just "getting old," but after my appointment with Maria, I realize that I have just been neglecting myself and that with her help I can feel great again!  She is worth every penny and I can't wait to go back next week.
