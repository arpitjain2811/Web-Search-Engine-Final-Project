Great price and great service.  I has a bad experience with another florist in Casa Grande and ended up at Greens & Things.  They charged me $75 less than the other florist  was going to charge and made the exact arrangement I wanted.  I couldn't be happier and I will use this florist whenever I need flowers in Casa Grande.

Still 5 stars and still the best florist in CG. They make it so easy to order flowers and don't charge a fortune either.

I ordered an arrangement for a celebration of life and they never delivered and didn't call to warn me. Didn't receive a call until the next day. Unprofessional and unreliable!

I send flowers every week and I wanted to make sure this flower shop could accommodate.  I called the store to speak with the manager and he was out to lunch. I was told by the girl working there that he would call me back when he returned.  He never returned my call.  A couple days later I sent an email and no response. If this is what they call customer service,  they are not worth my money.
