Few dentist offices are as professional and kind as Byce and Worman.  I bought a Groupon for them and was so pleased with everything, including their location.  The office building is clearly new, and full of sunlight.  The staff was warm and efficient for my first cleaning.  Bonus; they use a sonic device to remove most plaque instead of the old school scraping device that still haunts my nightmares.  On my second visit, fillings for a few cavities, Dr. Byce was thorough, professional, and really cared about my comfort. Finally, as a new client of their's, I was given 2, $50 gift cards for friends to spread the word.  When a card is used, I also receive a $50 credit on my account.

I feel kind of weird reviewing a dentist, but I like this place. All of the staff are really nice and good at what they do. Each exam room has massaging dentist chairs so you can relax when they're doing work on your teeth and they have a bunch of nifty gadgets. I came here for some chipped teeth and they used this laser thing to prepare the surfaces. Also they have this neat cleaning thing (I think it's called a waterpik or something) that agitates the plaque buildup off your teeth. Pretty cool. Also I think their pricing is reasonable, especially compared to my old dentist in Minnesota.
