Yet ANOTHER Italian restaurant on Antigua Street! It really amazes me. This restaurant, fittingly family owned and overwhelmingly Italian, is one of many of its kind in the area surrounding the Playhouse. They take advantage of this, and have a special pre-theatre menu, which I have to say is extremely reasonably priced! The starters, pizzas and pasta dishes are quite similar to those on their regular menu, although you won't find their fish dishes on this menu! I would definitely recommend saving yourself for the desserts, as every one of them is so tempting. I joined some friends there after their main meal, and the tiramisu I had was absolutely foodgasmic!

This is a pretty good restaurant and would recommend it if you want a decent meal before heading to the Playhouse. I came here with a couple of friends before watching a movie in the omnicentre just down the road. I ordered the Pizza Mamma Roma which came with asparagus, cheese and ham. I thought that the food tasted pretty bland, but the prices are reasonable and you do get good portions of food to ensure a full tummy. There are a huge amount of dishes on offer at Mamma Roma, and me and my friends only ordered pizzas there, so perhaps their food has more flavour in some of the other dishes. The decor is pretty nice, but is tainted by the fact that they seem to be playing up to the stereotypical Italian features and gives the place a cheesy feel to it.

Ordered pasta with mushrooms, asparagus and a cream sauce for takeaway last night. That's exactly what I got-no salt, pepper, or any herbs/spices/cheese. The worst part was that the asparagus and mushrooms were canned.
