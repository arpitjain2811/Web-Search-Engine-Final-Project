Abe just open another location on North 7th Street.  Really honest and considerate man.  Have you every went to a auto mechanic place and he has candles and a spread of food out?  Car wash, oil change and etc!

After having a horrible experience with another repair shop I was happy to have the experience I did at Simon and Sons. They were friendly and fixed my car quickly. It's definitely a small parking lot which makes it hard to maneuver around but it's worth it for the good service. And with free diagnostics you can't complain.

This is a scam... They're pretending to be another shop and they're really sunwest auto trying to rip you off. The real Simon and sons is a dif number and address. I was ripped off and both shops were caught in lies when confronted. Going to the better business bureaus to file complaint

It's the only car place I've ever trusted.  The parking can be tricky, but they will give you an honest deal. They even stayed open late for me. Abe is the man.

I grew up helping out at my dad's mechanic shop. I can spot a good mechanic. Abe is very affordable and does quite a good job. Would come back here any time.
