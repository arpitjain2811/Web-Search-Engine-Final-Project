First time I order from this pizzeria and their pizza is so good, full loaded with toppings, delivery is ok not to quick but I understand this place is busy. I love their Italian sub, that is real sub not with pepperoni, in most pizzeria das.

The food was really good! I had a Philly cheesesteak and a Gyro (lunch special). It was seasoned well and big portions. I would definitely order from here again.

Pizza and wings are good! Solid delivery time as well! Might try out the Gyro this time.

delivery was prompt but pizza was way under-cooked, and pie contents had slided around.  pie was cut carelessly.  middle of pizza was almost too gooey to even go back in the oven.

Absolutely terrible. We did not receive all the items in our order and they were not willing to fix it AND they did not give us a refund for the item. So basically they stole from us. The two pizzas they did deliver were burnt and the sandwich we ordered was bland and accompanied by soggy French fries.  AVOID THIS PIT. MANY BETTER OPTIONS.
