HOF mesa is great for anyone.  Whether you know a lot about fitness and just looking for the latest and greatest apps or totally clueless... Staff is easy to talk to and very approachable.  They offer best prices around so skip the hi health and gnc.  I recommend talking with Ray,  he knows his stuff.

After becoming discouraged with three other shops, we stumbled across HOF and will definitely return!!  Ray had everything we asked for and was willing to share knowledge on products.  Five stars easy!!
