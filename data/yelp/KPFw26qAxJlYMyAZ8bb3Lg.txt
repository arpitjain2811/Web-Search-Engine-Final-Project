Not been in for fabric.. but stopped in earlier in the week to get my brows & upper lip done in preparation for 'party season' coming up..  Â£7 to get brown & upper lip threaded which seems to be the going rate on Leith Walk. I walked in and was seen to straight away, although two others came while I was 'in the chair' and were seated and had to wait. I felt like she was a bit rushed with two people waiting. Although she was still pretty thorough and much more gentle than the other place I went to a few weeks back. Would def go back. Pretty sure they're cash only, so come prepared!
