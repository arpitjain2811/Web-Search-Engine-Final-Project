I don't like this store.  The manager was condisending to me once because I brought a propane container into the store to be filled.  I'm 32, not a 6 year old kindergardener. There produces IS good and there is a good selection.  Decent prices on booze too.  Their meats are poor at best.  I only come here when Albertson's, across the street, is out of something.

I love this fry's!  The cashiers and other staff are always so friendly and helpful.  I love that all my coupons the double to be $1.00 this helps out soooo much!  Always clean, well organized, and clearly priced.    The do have a play area for kids that is supervised by an employee at no cost to you while you shop.

I love this store!  The staff is super friendly and helpful. No lines ever. Produce is always fresh. My kids love to go to the kids corner so my shopping trips are a pleasure always. I even hit up Starbucks sometimes before I start! Can't ask for anything better than that!
