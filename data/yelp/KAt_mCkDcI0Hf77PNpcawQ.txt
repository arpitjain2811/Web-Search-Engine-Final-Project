Can't believe our good luck in finding Steve! We needed our truck's weather stripping and a small chip in our windshield fixed. Steve did both while we waited. He was so efficient, professional and friendly that we will surely recommend him to our friends and family!!!

This was the best window replacement company I've ever used!  I called several companies and they were far less expensive than anyone else and they were quick on both my initial home visit to measure my windows, and on installing just a few days later.  Could not have asked for better, kinder service at any price!
