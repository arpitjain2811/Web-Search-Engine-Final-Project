The food at this new cafe was very good and the service was great. Decor is western and very clean. Will go back soon.

REALLY enjoyed it! First visit, motorcycle parking outside, GREAT service, friendly waitress, LOVED the spicy potatoes, very reasonably priced. Recommend it!

The patty melt with a green chile add on was great.  It's definitely worth the walk from the downtown area to this little spot.
