We are truly lucky to have this place locally. If you need a electronic part they have it.  Weather you are building a elephant mind control machine, fixing a stereo or overclocking a calculator they have the tools and parts you need. I have bought many things from them, but the hardest to find item was a 1pf capacitor. No one sold them in numbers that a non manufacturing company would need execpt this place.   It is on the West side of Country club just after the train tracks underpass.  Yes this store is quite geeky on the level of living in a basement evil genius lab.

Products are good, but do not count on them for technical support.  Their staff is either unknowlegable or just does not care about customer support.  My two order inquiries were answered quickly, but the both responses were akin to 'go away and don't bother me."  I found another company that would support their products.
