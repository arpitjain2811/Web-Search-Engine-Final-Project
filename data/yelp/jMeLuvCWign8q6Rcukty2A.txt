Hobbs is the height of sophisticated fashion and seems aimed at those lucky women who always look smart and effortlessly stylish with trouser suits, tailored trousers and flowing dresses. Although I can appreciate Hobbs, it isn't really my style and the prices aren't really aimed at a student budget. Hobbs is aimed at the business woman who always looks trendy and is usually very mature. My pet hate is seeing women wearing man suits and my old boss used to wear them all the time... she was a dragon by nature and the suit just made her come across like the Incredible Hulk, minus the green skin. Hobbs always have very feminine, well tailored suits that are very flattering. Hobbs is very feminine with the prints, the cuts and the style and definitely worth a look if you're looking for something formal yet you can wear it everyday.
