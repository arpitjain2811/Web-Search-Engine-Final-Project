Great sandwiches the turkey original is my favorite. They aren't super fast but it's worth the wait. Way better then anything subway or paradise bakery has to offer. On a side note I tried the pizza one time and it was cold in the middle. Stick to the sammiches.

Stopped in while waiting for an oil change. Short wait and very curteous staff. They brought me napkins with my Club on a nice plate. Just a tad pricier than something like Subway, but better quality.

By far the best place to grab a sandwich or salad. Not your normal 'fast food' feel. Use real plates. Manager treats you like royalty. Never a bad experience
