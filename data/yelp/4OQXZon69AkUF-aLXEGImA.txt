schnelles und einfaches Essen. Nette Kellner. Obwohl man laut Ratgeber die Ecke des Strip meiden soll, da sie sich hinter dem Stratosphere Tower befindet. Das andre Denny's mitm aufm Strip ist mehr als gut besucht, egal ob von Sweet Sixteen, Junggesellenabschiede oder einfach nur hungrigen MÃ¤ulern

We wait FOREVER for our food every time we come here, no matter what time of day, even if it's a take/out order. However, I love Denny's and their food but aim for a different location!

4.5 stars? Are you out of your minds?! I went there last night out of pure desperation as it was so late. The only healthy thing on the menu was a tilapia dish which they wouldn't let me order cos I'm not a 'senior.' Am I not a paying customer? Who cares how old I am?! So anyway, I ordered a veggie burger with fries and rushed back to my hotel. Why? Cos I just couldn't sit there any longer! As I waited for my food, I noticed a humungous hair ball on the floor which kept blowing in towards me in the wind each time the door opened. And worse still - no one came to clean it up until after 20 mins! Ugh!! I can't tell you how many times I checked the inside of my burger! Never again!! No more slumming it in Vegas. It's just not worth it!

Service was good until we actually sat down to eat. It took longer then expected. We had a host by the name on StaciLynn whom was energetic but very slow. My girlfriend and I seen a mass load of people coming in and having to wait also the wait to pay for the food was long.
