I would recommend Harvey and his team to anyone. We worked with Harvey in selling our home last year and the process was smooth, professional and very comfortable. It was obvious from all our convesations and interactions that Harvey and his team truly had our best interest at heart and wanted to help us secure the best offer. If you have a home to sell or buy and are looking for an ethical, honest and experienced realtor, you definitely need to contact Harvey at Prudential Americana.

When we were looking for our new home we called Harvey with Brown Blankfeld. He was able to show us just what we were looking for. A "not so long story ends" with us getting our dream home. Thank you Harvey.
