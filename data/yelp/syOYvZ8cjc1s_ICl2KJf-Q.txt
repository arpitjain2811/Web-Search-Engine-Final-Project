My toe issues were cured from Dr. Burns. Thank you so much for your service.

Dr. Burns is a friendly, experienced doctor that I would recommend to anyone that has foot issues.  I've been to many foot doctors in southwest USA and Dr. Burns is the best!.

No help at all. Does not listen. Kept waving a wooden model of a foot at me. Told me I have arthritis when, in fact, I have a severely torn tendon in my foot. For this I had to pay?  Found out other DPM's are getting patients from Burns with the same complaints.
