This was mine and my wives first time here. The waitress was fantastic and the food was awesome. The prices were very inexpensive!  Must try!

I went here a couple of weeks ago and the service was absolutely horrible. Food was good, so we decided to give it another try this past weekend for a chance to redeem itself. The service this time was even worse. We waited 15 minutes just to get coffees and the lady still forgot our water. The food also took about 25 minutes and we ordered eggs, bacon and toast. Thisnuse to be a regular spot for me, but i cant stand the service. Never will I be going here again.
