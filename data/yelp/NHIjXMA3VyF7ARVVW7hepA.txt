My family and I have been seeing Dr. Traci Doan for the last 8 yrs and visits have always pleasant until today....she had different staff! I don't mind Ashley telling me procedures and charges BUT the hygienist, X-ray person and another woman in blue uniform.... WTF! 5 people had to tell me what needs to done! They were worst than salespeople pressuring me into buying a car....Dr. Doan and Kaitlyn are really nice but it's time to find a new dentist

Unfortunately my husband and daughter didn't have a positive experience . They felt they were constantly pushing unnecessary services for addition charges. They felt like they  were in car dealer parking lot then dentist office. I had called them to advised them of there experience and they didn't even care. It seem like they are more worry of cash revenue then patient care. So I had to change my rating.
