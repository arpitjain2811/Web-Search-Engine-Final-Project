The Clubhouse has a lap pool and a beach pool. The scenery is really pretty with the waterfalls and greenery surrounding and makes a nice setting for a private party or wedding. The staff is nice, but not always helpful.

Val Vista Lakes is an amazing place to live. The clubhouse facilities are really something to see. A jr Olympic swimming pool, a sand entrance lagoon pool with water falls with a lake as a background. All in the middle of Gilbert Arizona. A great place to spend time with family and friends.

This place is really great!  I tend to stick to racquetball when I come, but I have been to the clubhouse for weddings, receptions, and just to use the pool.  This place is off the hook!   They have a beach pool!
