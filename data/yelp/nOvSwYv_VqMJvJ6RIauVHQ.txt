We had a few issues with an older car but so we needed to be careful how much we invested in the vehicle. Lee kept us informed and gave us cost estimates as he went along. They finished the job on time and kept their word on the total cost of the repairs. Honest and trustworthy. I highly recommend them!

I go to Lee's for everything. They are always honest, courteous, and exceptionally quick.  Before we moved here from CA a different mechanic told me the water pump was out in my girlfriend's car, and quoted us $300 for the repair. We decided to wait to get it fixed until we moved out here. When we brought it to Lee's they said it was some minor tube or something like that (I'm clearly not a car expert) and it cost under $100 for the repair. After that I became pretty confident I could always trust them for an honest opinion.

Lee's did an oil change, tune up and new belts on my Jeep Wrangler.  They did a great job, didn't over charge and most importantly did NOT try to upsell me on every tiny thing.  I recommend.
