Hmmm Guacamole 6$ burger.  food - tasty burgers, as far as fast food goes, i think they have a tasty, Caloricly suicidal, burger...next to Burger King..i think it is the most flavorful and good (not saying good for you tho). also, i think they got new fries..because they were pretty damn good. location - ummm could be worse. needs a refresher, remodel.  employees - very nice. not bitter fast food workers. brought food to my table and i didn't need to leave a tip. corner of Washington and 24th street.

I feel silly giving a five star review to a fast food place but the service here was the best I've had at a fast food restaurant! Props to the lady working the front today, 11/12/13 4:30pm. Very helpful and sweet. The food was fresh and very tasty too. Two thumbs up :)

Good food! Friendly service! But Good food! Good service, but slow! Philly burger was awesome! Hubby loved the jalape√±o burger. Fries were fresh! Not bad for fast food! But must work on making it faster!
