You know what you are getting. Come on, this isn't the best pizza in town, but close enough to many homes in the Southern Ave and 19Th avenue basin.

Staff is unprofessional behind the counter and there's never any hot and ready pizza ready at a place that claims this as their motto.

I live in the area and come here often. Excellent fast service and the crew is energetic. The pepperoni pizzas for $5 are not world changing but it feeds larges family's and no one EVER complains about pizza. I like to order ahead for a freshly made 3 meat pizza. Always done within 10 minutes.
