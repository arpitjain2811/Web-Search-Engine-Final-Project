I just moved here a few weeks ago and on Sunday, two days ago, my pregnant belly was craving bananas and pineapple, so my hubs and I went to drive toward Fry's.  On our way, we see a guy holding a sign for the farmers market, we both thought that was a great idea and the fruit will be better. We turned around, pulled in and went to the "farmers market."  While walking we see signs about organic apples and fresh fruit.. but when we actually got there, the only fruit there was was a vendor selling juice and a man that had a single bell pepper and a melon both covered in dirt... probably because it was inside of a very dirty crate. We looked around, there were three other vendors there, none of which cosisted of any fruit or edible items at all.. someone selling bath loufas and cheap jewelry.  My hubs and I were stunned that this was the farmers market.. more like a crappy garage sale.  We were there around 12:30 so there should have been ..something! Will never go back here again.. weirdest farmers market i've ever been too.
