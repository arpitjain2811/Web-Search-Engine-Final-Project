They are fast, friendly, and they even have a dog treat for my pup when we drive through. Have never had any problems. They have never messed up our orders (a rarity in this area). That alone merits four stars!

Servers mixed up orders, overly salted fries, peach tea tasted rancid.

Food isn't great.  Standard fast food.  Shakes and drinks are good.  I like this location because its one of the few fast food options in Anthem that seems to care about customer service.  They always have a good attitude and smile and are quick.  If they do screw up they are quick to make it right.
