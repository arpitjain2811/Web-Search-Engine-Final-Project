Place is pretty cool. They have a large selection of European foods and a lot of healthy food items. If you want one of those natural soap bars, you can get them here too!

Wide variety, and extensive selection of gourmet, organic, and European fine foods. Though a three-stores-in-one concept needlessly complicates the checkout experience.

I love the Healthy Haven. I try to shop often at this little gem of a market. With everything from supplements from Fiddlehead's, David's Gourmet deli, the healthy butcher and Kara's fresh produce, what more could you ask for? Organic ice cream bar and coffee with agave nectar to sweeten it up? They've got that too. Oh and I can't forget the amazing salad bar in Kara's. There's almost too much goodness under one roof. I really think you owe it to yourself to check this place out. There's something for everyone. Rebecca  Gloss
