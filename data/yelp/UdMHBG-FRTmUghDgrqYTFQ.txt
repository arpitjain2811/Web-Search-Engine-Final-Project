It moves every week, where there are a number of great places to pick up fresh fruits and veggies. Ten dollars will get you as much as you want! Also it is much fresher than grocery store produce - mine has kept fresh for more than 2 weeks!

Great traveling farmers market! For $10 you get a ton of fresh produce! Awesome deal, awesome environment, overall it's just AWESOME!

Awesome selection, even during summer hours.  I came home with my 60 pounds, sorted through and divided out what my boyfriend and I would be able to eat in 2 weeks, then went to work putting together an assortment of produce for neighbors and friends.  A great value and a great way to help your community.
