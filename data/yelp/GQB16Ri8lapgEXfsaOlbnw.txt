My daughter loves to draw and paint, there was a place like this back home that we used to go to all the time, so glad to have found this place so we can continue to enjoy painting art pieces for the people we love... They do birthday party's for kids as well.. The owner was really nice we will be back..

Very cozy place and friendly staff. The items are a little pricey but include unlimited studio time and paint. We went for ladies night and it was 25% off which was awesome! And there were some snacks as well. I would definitely go back, and probably being a bottle of wine to enjoy.
