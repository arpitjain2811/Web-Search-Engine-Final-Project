As someone who eats sushi regularly, I regard this restuarant as one of the best.  It has only been open for 3 months.  The owner is very nice and the staff very friendly.  We tried their special rolls on recommendation of the waitress, Norway and Crazy Salmon.  The Crazy Salmon was especially tasty.  Their sashimi (we tried the red tuna) was melt-in-your-mouth tender and fresh.  The quality of the sushi at this restaurant was fantastic.  The price is decent for a sushi restaurant, but they don't have combo deals.  Everything is priced out separately, including miso soup, edamame, and small salad.

Great fish, great prices, awesome service! They have a great outdoor patio. So many choices now in Gilbert, you will not be disappointed with Takara. Some of our favorites: spicy tuna salad, spicy salmon skin hand roll & Jennifer roll. Large beers to go with sushi only $2.99. Very few places (trust me, we go to all of them) offer the quality they have here. The way the owner puts these rolls together is incredible. The attention to detail of every single plate that comes out is amazing.
