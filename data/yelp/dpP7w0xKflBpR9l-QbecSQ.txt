Average Starbucks. Slow drive-thru and needed me to repeat my order three times.

Watch how they ring you up - they rang me up for a black tea lemonade when I ordered just black tea. The clerk claimed it was because I asked for a splash of flavoring (not even a pump of syrup). 2 drinks + small food items was $20. Bad service and rude employee. The employee who made my drink did add the flavoring for me which was nice.  Aria - these employees need to be trained up to meet your service levels that I have learned to expect.
