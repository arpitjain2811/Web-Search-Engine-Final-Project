Dr. Wirig is a wonderful Orthodontist!  I have had braces three times and my experience with Dr. Wirig was the best.  His staff is very friendly and professional.  I will definitely be taking my 4 children to him for braces.

Dr. Wirig and his staff are wonderful!  We took our three kids there for a consult and they loved it so much now none of them can wait to get their braces!  ;-)  They had a fun scavenger hunt and the Dr. and staff made them all feel like they were VIP's while we were there.  Looking forward to going back!

Such an amazing group of staff! The 2 Ortho's, Ortho Assistants, Treatment Coordinator and Front Desk - they are all fantastic. I definitely would recommend anyone looking to get braces to go to Wirig Orthodontics!
