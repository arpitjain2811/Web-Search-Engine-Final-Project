The snappy and juicy dogs combined with fresh tasty buns provide a solid base for a few different dogs. I had the General Lee and it was fantastic and my homie seemed to love the vegan dog! The french fries had been seasoned really well and the house made hot sauces are flavorful and spicy! It's my first visit but there will be many more I'm sure!

Mark my words you guys have evolved the hot dog. I have had a dodger dog a dog at Fenway in Boston and I think the bread the dog the toppings. You have blown them all away.

Checked them out at the food truck rally by the tony hseih's downtown project.  They had a prefetch solid lobster tempura dog with Siraracha mayo, greens and onions.  Surprisingly fast.
