My mother-in-law got me a pedicure with her manicurist Cheryl at Salon Picasso for my birthday.  Cheryl is fabulous!  This is by far the best pedicure I've gotten.  Okay, atmosphere loses a point or so because of where they put the pedicure chairs, but it's far outweighed by the level of pampering your piggies will be receiving while you drift off into your happy place.  Go see Cheryl, and your tootsies will thank you, and you'll thank me.

New to the area, I was looking for nail salons and came here. After a week 4 of my nails peeled off easily and the rest were all well on there way to coming off. Wont be going there again.

I am new to the area and desperately needed my hair cut. I was referred to Steve Nichols and was so pleased with my hair cut. I have never had someone take as much time cutting and perfecting a style. I have long hair...and still have long hair! Most hair dressers like to chop off long hair! I can now wear my hair down .... as it has such great shape to it with the layers he fixed from my last cut else where.  Thank you Steve.... and thank you Karen for the referral.
