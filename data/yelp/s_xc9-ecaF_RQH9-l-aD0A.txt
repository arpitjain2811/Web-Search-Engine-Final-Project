Great variety of vegan treats and every single one is delicious.  Best vegan baked goods I've ever had!

Amazingly delicious! Finally, something vegan that's not trying to be healthy! Sometimes you just gotta indulge!

So, I was with my fiance visiting family in Vegas, and we had a mix of Vegan and non-Vegan people to feed. It can be difficult to find something that satisfies both but Bite def did the trick.  Personally, I thought the food was way better than many versions I've had with dairy/eggs, etc. Pretty shocking actually! Highly recommend the monkey bread and caramels. The Vegan eaters in the group found a new favorite place and they go to the market to stock up on the Bite goodies on a weekly basis now.

Best chocolate cake I ever tasted. We love her baked goods. And the prices are good. Bite rocks.

Grabbed a pie shaped chocolate chip cookie (made with chickpeas) for my picky 2 year old. She barely let me have one bite but it was amazing!

My favorite vegan treats in town! Every Saturday at Tivoil, it's a must. I need to start getting 2 of each cause they are to good to share
