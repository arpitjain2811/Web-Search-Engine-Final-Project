Awesome!!! Kelly takes such wonderful care of any animal and leaves you with a sense of security while leaving your home and fur babies. I absolutely love her and have recommended her to others as well. Dogs, cats, house plants? No problem! Seriously, the beat.

My wife and I are very protective of our pets. Kelly and her husband take such good care of our cats when we are gone (which is all too frequently) that they truly are "Pampered Kitties". We have worked with Kelly for 5 years, trust her completely and give her our highest recommendation to anyone looking for a high-quality, high-service pet sitter.

Having experienced other pet sitters, I can definitely endorse Kelly for her ability to go above and beyond in caring for our pets.  She takes time to visit and 'talk' with our cats rather than a quick feed and water. Kelly is completely trustworthy and dependable. Pampered Kitty (or dog) is just that!

I HATE to leave my dog at home when we go on vacation, and I know my dog hates it too, but I think he is much happier at home than locked up in a cage.  Having just moved to the area, and not knowing anyone to pet sit, we turned to Kelly.  I was really nervous, but Kelly did an outstanding job. My dog is just a little lap dog and Kelly would just sit with him the entire time.  She even wanted to take him home!  She took care of the alarm and sent pictures everyday of my dog.  So happy to know I have someone I can trust with my dog when we go on vacation in the future.
