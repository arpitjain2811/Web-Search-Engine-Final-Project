Really like this car wash. Always clean facilities. Good water pressure. Vacuum went for a long time (able to vacuum my SUV thoroughly, including the back). Even an automatic car wash on location.

No card option, just coins.  Two of the stalls were inoperable (coins jammed and stuck into slots).

The best do it yourself car wash in the northwest part of the valley with ease.  For ever .25 cents you get 40 seconds, most other places I've been to you only get 30 seconds for every .25 cents.  Plus their pressure washer is super powerful and not to mention the soap brush gives out plenty of suds where others do not put out nearly as much.  If you live in the area and are looking for a good place to wash your vehicle I would recommend this place.
