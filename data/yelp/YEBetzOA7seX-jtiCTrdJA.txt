I've been to the store a few times, getting started in the hobby.Tony, the owner, has been particularly helpful.  They've earned my business enough that I will make this the default LFS as I grow my marine setup.

Despite getting out of the saltwater hobby for now, I still love to visit local fish shops. This was a fun one to visit. The floors are covered in sand to give you that under the sea feeling as you shop their wares. The selection of livestock and dry goods was limited, but adequate. The gentleman working was nice, but paid us little attention. When I get back into the hobby, I will be sure to swing by Top of the Reef again.
