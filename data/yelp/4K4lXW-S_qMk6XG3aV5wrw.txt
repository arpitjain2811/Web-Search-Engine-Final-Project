This place is right behind my work. Great food, friendly service, clean, highly recommend it. The salsa is (spicy or mild) is vary fresh. Chips aren't greasy Lots of items to choose from. The portion sizes and price are great.

I was visiting another business in the mall and saw this restaurant and gave it a try for lunch. I'm glad I did as the food was great. Burritos, tacos, salads, quesadillas and enchiladas were the menu items. The fun part is you go down the line (like Subway) and add your ingredients. Each ingredient looked and tasted fresh. Prices are reasonable.  If they served beer, it would be a 5 star.
