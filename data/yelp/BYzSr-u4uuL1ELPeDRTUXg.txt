My daughter has attended CCPK for the past two years.  We love this school!  It's a great Christian environment with excellent teachers.  It has been obvious to me since my daughter started attending CCPK that the teachers truly love the kids.  I (being slightly neurotic about leaving my child) feel very safe leaving her every day, and she loves to go! She has learned so much in the two years she's been there - I couldn't be more pleased with our experience at this school.  It's wonderful!

This is Scottsdale/NE Phoenix's best kept preschool secret.  Fantastic teacher/student ratio, hands on, loving teachers, and great curriculum.  Art projects, plenty of outdoor space, in a caring environment.  Our son is in the junior kindergarten and we wish we had found CCPK when he was first starting school.  And the tuition is reasonable, with flexible before and aftercare programs.
