I hope that a sinkhole opens under this nuisance.  The lack of noise barriers and the racing of unregulated unmuffled cars makes this audible for miles around on Sundays in the summer.  If this was in any other city it would have been closed long ago for noise and pollution inside city limits.  Hopefully the new assistant living community right next door will complain enough that it gets shut down.

Dear Angell Park, even when I don't know who's behind the wheel any more it's still pretty cool to see those guys drive the hell out of that clay track. Old school fun. Thanks for the nostalgia! You're still cool. Xoxo Stephanie
