The  food here is delicious and perfectly seasoned. Lisa & Stephanie look just like their moms & it touched my heart to see the working together.  This is a great place to grab a bite to eat that won't empty your pockets.  The food & service will keep you coming back for more.  Loved, Loved, Loved the chicken waffles & the hush puppies!   If you're looking for real soul food, look no further!

Tucked away in the corner of a very tiny strip mall is this ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS place. I came in and it was empty,I was the only person here. The 2 women working behind the counter/kitchen couldn't have been more friendly and welcoming and suggestive when it came to me being indecisive about what I wanted to order. Food is flavorful,juicy,and just plain ole fashioned home cooked yumminess. I just wish this place had more visible signage alone the roadside.

Today I had a friend suggest Mother's Wings & Thinks. The Staff was friendly. The food was great! I recommend the Mac & Cheese. Thank you for a great experience.
