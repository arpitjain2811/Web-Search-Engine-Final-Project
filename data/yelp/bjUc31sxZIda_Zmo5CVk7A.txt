Kara is very professional and her Brazilian waxing is truly painless! Her success is also inspired me to open my own business, thank you Kara and good luck!

I moved to Scottsdale in Jan. and tried a few places before LUCKILY coming across Kara!!! I have worked in the spa industry for the past 10 years and she is the best person I have ever been to for waxing. I had the worst experience ever at MOZAIK and would never recommend anyone to go there. Not only was my wax completely botched and left me with peeled off skin everywhere, I had to follow up with my complaint with the owner twice who made me feel like I had done something wrong.  Not only is Kara professional she also keeps a clean environment, and is extremely knowledgeable. Her technique is painless and super clean( she gets every hair). Do not try other people Kara is your girl for facials and waxing! A+++++++

The first time I went in, it was for a brow wax. Kara suggested a tint and, seriously, who KNEW my brows could look so good!!! Anyway, I was curious about a Brazilian and asked her a TON of questions. The next time I went in, I went for it. My first waxing was a bit painful, but Kara is fast and so professional. If you are thinking about it...I say go for it, because it really doesn't hurt that bad (after the first time) and I LOVE IT!!!

Kara is absolutely wonderful! She does a GREAT waxing and I am going to have her do a facial for me very soon.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and Kara is an absolute doll of a person. I would highly recommend her!
