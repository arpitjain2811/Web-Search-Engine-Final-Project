Such a gem in the hot hell that is Las Vegas!  I used to eat here at least once if not twice a week.  They make these ginormous taco salads with a homemade vinaigrette that I crave all the way over here in SoCal.  Can't speak for much else on the menu since I'm stuck on the salads! Be warned they are closed on Sundays!
