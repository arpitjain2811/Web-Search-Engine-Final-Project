This is pretty nice for the money. It's sort of hard to find as you walk down the street. It's in a set of out buildings BEHIND the ones on the street and it's not too far from the high street so keep your eyes peeled. The trampolines are awesome. The jukebox is full of good tunes and the prices are very decent. Those kids will be very worn out. WIN.
