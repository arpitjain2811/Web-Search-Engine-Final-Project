Cool flavors, good toppings but I wish there were more toppings-like snow caps or raspberries. The mochi was kind of hard ad stale. Still yummy-I'll probably be back

Had 14 flavors to select from. All 5 I picked were excellent. Loved the mango toppings as well as all the chocolate varieties along with my favorite toasted coconut!!!! Will definitely return!
