This KFC never has the chicken you want ready.  The staff and customers are awful.  The dining room is often hazy with smoke flowing out of the kitchen.  I go here only because it's close to work and sometimes I really want a side or sandwich which they usually have.

This place CANNOT EVER give me everything I order. They are the most worthless, slack jawed, habitual screw up's I have ever witnessed. Not only do they always forget something, but half the menu will take "another 16 minutes" according to the drive up attendant. Dont ever stop here!!!!!You will regret it!!!!Check your order before you pull away at least!!!
