Tiffany was so incredibly nice to deal with over the phone!  I sold my property and needed work done while I was in California.  Tiffany looked at my inspection report and had an estimate to me in less than 2 hours.  They performed the work and it was less than the estimate!  Can you believe these guys!  Nothing like a licensed contractor folks, look  no further for help.

Ed came and added the remotes to two existing ceiling fans (yay, my daughter & I can adjust or turn them off while in bed now!) and found the problem in one connection in no time.   Best of all, I wasn't charged an outrageous amount.  I have found our electrician!

I called Apache Dee's to get some information,and Tiffany answered the phone.  She was SO HELPFUL and could arrange with my schedule to get some work done.  Great service!
