I'm so glad to see QT at this location.  It's located on 32nd St (University Dr) just off I-10.  A couple of it's neighboring competitors have slipped in terms of cleanliness and safety.  If QT can maintain  the new property in it's pristine condition, it'll be a welcome change for this area.  Oh, and the floor plan is similar to the new-ish Thomas Rd & SR 51 store.  :)

I go out of my way for Quik Trip. But it's Phoenix so you don't need to. They are everywhere, like weeds. But good weeds, maybe more like roses. Anyway, the Super QT is like most. And even though it was 5:30 PM and loaded with people, I still found a pump to gas up. The sandwiches were almost all gone- probably a dinner rush, but I still took a ham sammy, got a refill drink, used the mostly clean restroom and was on my way happily. Love QT!
