I had a great experience with SunsationLV, the tan came out very well, exactly what I wanted! Not only is the pricing very reasonable, but it is also very convenient that they come to you. Next time I need a tan, I know I will be calling SunsationLV!

GREAT Experience!  My wife and I are pregnant and recently made a trip to Vegas for a friends birthday.  With my wife unable to tan and needing a little color for the night we were referred to SunsationLV by some friendly locals.  Within a few hours of our call we had a representative at our hotel door step ready to serve.  My wife was treated extremely well and her tan came out perfect!  SunsationLV  was professional, courteous and priced well.  We will definitely use them again on our next Vegas visit.
