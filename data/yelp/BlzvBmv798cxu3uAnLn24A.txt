This is a quirky place. Full-time place of business. Full-time artist gallery. Now you'd think that wouldn't work... but it does. Ah, the strangeness of Tempe and web-workers. And though it's not open to the public at all times, I'd be on the look out for future events here. The outside patio is immense and beckons with a great view of the mountains and stars. It's got night time entertainment written all over it. Can't wait for the next time!

Is it a Gallery?  Is it an intimate place for friends to gather?  It's really both.  #EVFN had the pleasure of having small gathering there tonight 05/01/2009.   This small gallery located in a business plaza around ASU's campus is not only a great location for upcoming artists but has a spectacular view of the surrounding campus.  It's a must see. If you are invited  to or they schedule an event here don't miss it as you will miss out on everything that makes this place special.
