Wow!  This girl is amazing.  She gave me a beautiful, totally original hair style that I absolutely loved and no way could have done myself.  Her ability with makeup is outstanding.  My pics looked gorgeous.  She is also very sweet, fun, and great to work with.  I felt totally comfortable with her.  Thanks, Steph Viva!  You made my special day just perfect!

Eloped in Vegas and needed a hair stylist. Searched on craigslist and was impressed by Steph's photos. I am pretty critical of who touches me as I am a 15 year journeyman makeup artist for the film industry but samples of her work gave me the confidence she could design the look I wanted. Steph went over any beyond my expectations and literally gave me the wedding hair of my dreams. Best she was on time, with a great personality and very personable. Anyone would be lucky to have Steph Viva beatify them for a special occasion.
