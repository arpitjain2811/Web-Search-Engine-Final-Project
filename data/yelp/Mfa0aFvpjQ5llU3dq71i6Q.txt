I hate to admit it, but yes, I do eat here occasionally.  About once every couple of months I break all the rules and get some junk food during lunchtime at work.  I happen to love fried chicken and it just so happens that this place is about a ten second drive from my office and is really the only place around. I get the same thing every time I go:  the chicken strips with ranch dipping sauce and a giant diet coke.  SOOOO good but SOOOO bad for me.  It screws up my stomach for about a day and I always swear I'll never go back but I always do. It is a bit on the expensive side for fried strips of chicken but whatever.  It is quick and easy and the people that work there are always friendly and quick with your order.

Excellent chicken tenders and biscuits.  I also like the fish combo they have for Lent. Lobby was nice and clean.

If you can get past the fact that most Church's are located in pretty ghetto areas, it's a decent place to get fried chicken. I hadn't been to a Church's in probably 20 years and I don't know that I'll return anytime in the next two decades. Overall, Church's is crispier than KFC but not as flavorful as Popeye's. It tasted good, but its nothing special.  Similarly, service was... serviceable. They took my order and money and got my food. If you want basic fried chicken this is a place for you.

Food was good, fresh and hot. Customer service was solid, but the location is pretty dresdful.
