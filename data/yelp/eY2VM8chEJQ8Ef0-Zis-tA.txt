While searching for new carpet we stopped here to check out the choices and prices. Huge showroom. So many choices of flooring. I wish I could have hardwood, too many rules in my condo HOA. :( I knew I wanted a medium dark gray carpet. I found the perfect color, great padding, you have to have good padding. And best of all a great price.  The Salesman David was great. Did not try to oversell or push anything on us. He came to our place to measure.  The carpet was installed 2 weeks later and it is fabulous. George and his team did a fantastic job on the installation.  Professional and neat.  Should I need flooring again, this is where I will be going.

We have had dealings with Cloud Carpet for years and I have to say that there is old fashioned customer service there.  If you want people who really care, you can find it at Cloud Carpet.  I have to agree with the previous reviewer.  Dave and George are great. I recommend them to everyone.
