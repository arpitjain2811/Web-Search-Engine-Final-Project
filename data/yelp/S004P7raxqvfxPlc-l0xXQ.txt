Yeah, yeah, yeah... CRR (chain-restaurant-review). Coffee Bean is the newest coffee shop addition to the Fashion Show Mall. They're located in a semi-permanent structure that they share with Auntie Anne's pretzels right in front of the runway. They opened up a few weeks ago and I think they'll give Starbucks a run for their money. The coffee tastes better, service friendlier, and lines quicker. Plus, mall employees get 50% off everything Mon-Thurs. 20% rest of the week! You mean I can get a large latte for under $3? Amazing! I met the owner of this particular location in the beginning and he was pretty darn friendly--thanking people for choosing them over Starbucks and taking the time to spread the CBTL love with a few customers. Only thing, sometimes the foam comes out a little too frothy (like soap suds). But I'll excuse it for a little while while the new baristas kick the learning curve.

Finally got to sample this place before leaving Vegas! They seem like an awesome coffee chain, I had the dark chocolate espresso based drink, it was better than a frappuccino. Wish they were in NY!
