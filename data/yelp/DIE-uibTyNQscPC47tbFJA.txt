I do not often shop at walmart, but I was in need of some soap, and cereal. So I just stopped by, it was easy to find, and everything looked pretty clean and organized.

I too rarely shop at Walmart and this has to be one of my all-time least favorites! This is a Neighborhood Market and not a Super Center so only go here if you are in search of groceries, cleaning supplies, or personal care products. I solemnly swore to myself the other night I would NEVER shop at this location again. Since moving to the area about five months ago they have had white onions on only two of my visits. White onions are a pretty imperative veggie to have on hand! They also do not have much diversity in their vegetables (ie: no basil). The bean and legume section is seriously lacking  as well. No garbanzo beans? At least they have a fairly decent liquor, wine, and beer selection, but Safeway has much better prices.

For all you walmart haters, the neighborhood stores are clean small and has everything  you want from a supermarket. It's close to my house and cheap to shop. So it's a win win. Also it's never busy so I never have to wait in line.

Aside from being a monopoly in the grocery industry, this location isn't bad.   It's a "Neighborhood Walmart", so it is more like a supermarket rather than a super center.  Overall, it has a decent selection and competitive prices.
