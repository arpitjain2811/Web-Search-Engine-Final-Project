Nice selection and variety...However the prices are through the roof...then again who said golf was inexpensive. I came in looking for lighter weight clothing, but I was really turned off by the prices. I must be a cheap skate.

Best place in Phoenix for equipment.  Staff is very helpful. Prices are competitive. F.S.

I need a gift for my husband's birthday and I stopped in the Hornacek's. They had everything I needed, since my husband is an avid golfer. The staff was friendly and knowledgable and very professional. I will definitely go back for all of our golf necessities..
