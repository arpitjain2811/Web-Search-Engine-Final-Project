When dealing with Justin and his team on plumbing issues, they are always straight forward and fair.  Not only does Service plus answer questions over the phone about plumbing issues in Las Vegas, they are prompt and have fair prices.  I would recommend Service Plus to family members!

These guys really saved me! Over the winter we had a pipe burst one evening at our rental property and these guys not only told my tenants  how to turn the water off so no further damage was done but they were out first thing in the morning to fix it. Amazing costumer service and outstanding work and incredible prices ;)

Their service is okay, professional and friendly.  However they charge for quotes even though their website states "free quote" plus they are expensive.

These guys were fast, dedicated and professional. Had a difficult leak to find and Mitt came out to fix it. I was very pleased and their prices were reasonable. I will use them again.
