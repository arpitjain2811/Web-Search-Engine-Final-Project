You won't find another workout that kicks your a$$ like HYBRID. One hour of sweat, weights, ropes, keg swings, rock throws, tires flips, sprints and of course state of the art sound system and projector.

The bar fitness is the best place I have worked out ever, the members and the staff make it feel like it is a fitness family. It's hybrid trainer Ryan is my favorite trainer, and will push you to your best no matter how fit or unfit you are u will reach your future goal. I would recommend this to all my friends and family.
