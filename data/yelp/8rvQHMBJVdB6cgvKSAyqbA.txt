This is the cheapest gas station I've been able to find near the Vegas strip. The convenience store is well stocked with essentials. I'd recommend this place.

Beware, this place is ripping you off, in my opinion.  Because my gas gauge is broken, I fill up based on miles driven since last fill up and know how many gallons are needed to fill the tank with great accuracy.  The one time I bought gas here, the pump said it dispensed about three gallons more than my tank should have been able to hold.

I thought the slot machines were pretty welcoming. It gives the feeling you're in Las Vegas even when you are on the way out of state.
