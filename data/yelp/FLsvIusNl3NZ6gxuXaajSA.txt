From the outside this branch of KFC looks like a kiosk, but as soon as you walk in you see the sign 100 extra seats down stairs what real use is that if they close it off after 6pm. Majority of the staff here look scruffy gone the days and the tv adverts showing a guy or girl with clean ironed shirt & hat. They do have free wifi but never seems to work. The price of the boxed meals have gone up Â£1 since l last ate at one of these places.
