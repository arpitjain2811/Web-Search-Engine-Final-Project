Renting the paddle boards was super easy. Heather was very helpful. She explained everything we would need. We drove out to  Saguaro lake for the day. I recommend going early cause the lake gets super busy.  Bring water, sunscreen and some snacks:)

This was great! No Snow owners made it easy to pick up boards, gave safety lessons, and even let's us borrow sunglass holders. Totally doing it again!

My husband and I rented boards from no snow this morning, and let's just say I am already planning when I can go back!! It was a great experience from beginning to end. I loved that it was a hassle-free, quick rental process, and the folks at no snow were so nice.
