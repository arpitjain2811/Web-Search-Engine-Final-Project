I don't know if we got lucky but we got seen really fast. The only negative is that it took for ever for us too leave. I sat around waiting my the desk to see when they would let us go. So after about an hour of waiting I finally asked and the nurse just grabbed my hubbys folder and said you are go to go. WTF waiting for 1 hour  The doctor was great I saw that he works for ACES he is not employed through North Vista.Very understanding and nice quickly diagnosed the situation.

What a crappy hospital!  They don't change bedsheet, have no consideration about patients or their time schedule. They abuse insurance too. Wanted my friend to stay for 3 weeks for no particular reason. Someone please do something about this health care system. These kind of hospitals should be shut down in a heartbeat.
