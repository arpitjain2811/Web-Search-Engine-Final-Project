Easily the best food around town! I was born and raised in Brooklyn so I'm used to great NY pizza. These guys make great PIZZA!!  I came here the next day so I could taste the cheese steak for lunch and I must say they got that covered too. Very flavorful. All of their ingredients seem to be very fresh and for comfort food it is not greasy at all.  The staff is extremely friendly and will pretty much satisfy every need for good food you have. I'm so hungry just thinking about this place  ;-)  It's true. Kyle is The Legend they say he is.

Tasty pizza but two hours for delivery when told one. Wouldn't order again when with kids.

Adios lousy pizza. This place is shuttered and gone with the wind. How does somebody spend all that cash to get a prime Mill location and not know how to make what he is trying to sell. Good riddance. Too bad Mill could use a good pizza joint - Slices stinks too.
