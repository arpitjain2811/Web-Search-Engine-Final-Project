Stopped by this Subway on the drive back home to Vegas from Phoenix.  It is conveniently located on the right side of the road heading to Vegas. I ordered a 6" BMT w/Jalapeno Cheddar Bread & had it toasted.  I added Tomatoes, Lettuce, Green Peppers, Pepperoncinis, Mustard, Mayo, Oil, Vinegar, Salt, Pepper.  They made it quickly and I was eating in no time. The ingredients were very fresh and the Sandwich tasted great.  A nice snack for the ride home. A bonus is the clean restrooms....a quick tip is to stop here to use the restroom instead of a nasty gas station....every gas station in Wickenberg was busy with travelers using the restrooms. Will I return?  Next time I drive to/from Phoenix, I will.

This subway has terrible service. The food is just ok and the space is not well kept.
