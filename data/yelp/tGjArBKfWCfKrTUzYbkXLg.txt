I came in to get a price adjustment on a product that went on sale 3 days after I purchased it. I didn't need to bring the product it, just my receipt and the card I used. It was quick & easy! I didn't originally buy the product (a 10-piece comforter set) from this location, but they were still able to give me the price adjustment. I was told price adjustments were valid 2 weeks from the purchase date, but make sure to verify! The ladies in this store are very helpful. I think the store is well organized for all the things it has, including window coverings, beds-in-a-bag, sheet sets, bathroom items, etc. Some of the products are really high up, so make sure you get help. Also, they have a clearance section near the front. Overall, I think this store is satisfactory. I recommend it.

Anna's Linens has an abundance of items for your kitchen, bath, bedroom, and more. Sheets, blankets, pillows, towels, the list goes on and on.  The reason I don' t frequent AL more often is that the quality of the merchandise seems to not be as high as other stores that sell similar products. The store seemed in a bit of disarray the day I went. The employees seemed to just be working for their paychecks and not really enjoying their jobs. The prices at AL can't be beat. I just hope that the items I bought today will last me a long time.
