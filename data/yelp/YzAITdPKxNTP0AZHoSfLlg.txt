Beat this - quick response, time to completion of 30K service of a Hyundai Sonata and fixed the brakes for just $300. Been driving 10K since and it drives like new.  This guy is ASE certified and has worked on all type of cars but specializes in Japanese imports: Acura/Honda, Toyota/Scion/Lexus, Mazda, Nissan/Infiniti, Subaru, Kia, and Hyundai

My family and I have been customers for a couple of years now. They're  knowledgeable and down to earth. Every time I've taken my 97 Honda Accord to get serviced, they diagnose the problem quickly and always give fair prices on parts.

I honestly would never take my RSX to any other shop because this shop treats my car with more respect then I do. Told my family about it and now every one goes there. Quality service.
