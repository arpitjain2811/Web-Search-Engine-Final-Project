My whole family has been going to Black Wrench Automotive for probably 8 years. Antoine has always been honest and gone out of his way to save us money wherever he can. He always manages to squeeze us in on short notice. It's a pleasure leaving there and NEVER worrying that I was taken advantage of. Thanks again.

I came to Black Wrench after reading the other review here, and I must say it is definitely worth all 5 stars!  Antoine and Michelle are extremely nice, friendly, knowledgeable, and most importantly - honest.  Their prices are better than any of the other corporate big name (and terrible service) shops, and Antoine really pays attention to even the smallest details.  We will definitely be coming back here for all our auto needs from now on!
