Best prices on cigarettes, don't really do anything else but come here and buy my tobacco.

What kind of a place is this supposed to be? A hangout for dumbbells? There's nothing in this place. Is this a joke? There are slot machines in the middle of the floor and a counter of some kind off on one wall. They sell.... cigarettes?..... pies?.... Can I get a pie, please? Do they sell small bags of chips? Chewing gum? Bic lighters? How about a free toothpick? Can I have a book of matches? So much empty floor space. As I recall, there were only about 6 slot machines in the whole joint? Oooooh, funnnnn!! C'mon, Dotty, jazz up your dump. Gimmee a burger and fries. Gimmee a hot dog with extra mustard. Gimmee! This company seems to do well since Dotty has a chain of these slot machine garages all over Vegas. Not much here for me. I can have more fun stomping on ketchup packets.
