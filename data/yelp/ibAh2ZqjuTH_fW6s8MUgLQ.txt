Very good cleaning service.  I used them to deep-clean clean a rental we moved into recently.  It was money well spent!  Their communication was excellent and they even called a few days after the job to make sure we were happy.  I look forward to using them again soon.

I used iclean to clean my house prior to having guests stay for the weekend. They did such a great job. The whole house was cleaned to my liking. They even did little touches like folding the toilet tissue rolls and bath towels into little designs. My master bathroom roll looked like a little tuxedo and bow tie! My house guests complimented me on how clean my house was.They called a few days after to see how my experience was. I will definitely use them again and refer their services to family and friends.

I used IClean about a month and a half ago for a deep clean after finding their coupon in my zip code magazine.  They were able to come the same day I called and the two girls did an amazing job!!! Unfortunately, I paid in cash and couldn't remember the name of the company and had to use someone else the last time I had my home cleaned and was nowhere near as happy with the results but thankfully figured out from phone logs and will be calling IClean to come back out!!
