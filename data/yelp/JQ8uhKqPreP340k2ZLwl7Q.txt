This store, which usually has pretty decent if not good customer service,  gave me a HORRIBLE customer experience recently!! I came to the store during reg business hours (around 2:00 in the afternoon) & the kid who was working put a sign on the door "be back in 15 minutes". I went home & came back 15 minutes before closing hours & the rude, non-business-understanding kid who left earlier (I'm sure without the owner knowing) told me they were closed (15 minutes before 8!!) I was turned away twice on the same day. I needed water since me & my kids had none at home.  I told the young man that I had been there earlier & was turned away by the "be back in 15 minutes" sign but he still wouldn't let me in...15 MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING TIME!! .  I will never give my business to this store again!
