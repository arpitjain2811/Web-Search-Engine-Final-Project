Terrible service. Called after I purchased an item for service and they brushed me off. Last time I will be coming here and will tell everyone to stay away.

I have been coming to Kiesub Electronic Supply for 20 years. They have always went out of their way to help solve my Electronic issue. Great people. Great source of parts and equipment.

I happened to come across Kiesub while trying out the BBQ place next door. When I walked in I was like a kid in a candy store. LED's, hand tools, shrink wrap...the selection in the showroom was quite extensive. They also carried all sorts of transformers. If you've got a need for an AC transformer with specific output...check here.  Pricing seems to be slightly towards the higher side...for example I can get 3M electrical tape in all the colors cheaper elsewhere. But sometimes you need it, Amazon isn't fast enough and it's good to know Kiesub exists. I will be back.

Bad service and a small selection of supplies.  I stood around for 20 mins in this small store and not one person offered to help me find what I needed.  I'll be heading to fry's and radio shack instead.

Friendly people, open Saturday and they're the only store in town (besides Fry's) that carries a decent selection of electrical parts. They don't carry "everything" and they're not as cheap as ordering online, but they always seem to have the part I need in stock.
