My new favorite nail salon. Amazing family owned spot with great talent. Teresa does amazing nail art and lashes. I love, love this place. Will be back very soon. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a consistent nail salon you can trust.

Got a gel mani & regular pedi - cost=$55.. Little too pricey for me especially coming from San Diego where it only cost me $38 for the exact same service. The nail tech was nice and friendly though. My nails turned out ok ... Nothing special...Just feel this salon is overpriced.
