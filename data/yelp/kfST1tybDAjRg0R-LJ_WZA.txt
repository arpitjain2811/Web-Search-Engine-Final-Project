I have back yard chickens and I used to buy their feed in Jones & Rancho feed store. Ones this store opened I started using them to buy feed and from time to time new baby chicks. I found that they are more friendly than the staff at Jones store and they have baby chicks almost all year round. The store is well organized and they offer other products for horses and live stock. The reason that I gave them only four stars is that they open from 9:00 am in the morning on week days. I hoped that they would have opened at 7:00 am.

V & V is my go to tack and feed store.  They're small enough to recognize me and yet still able to carry a wide variety of items.  On at least two occasions they had items that I needed that the big stores didn't have.  Plus, if they don't have what I need they'll order it without it being a big deal.
