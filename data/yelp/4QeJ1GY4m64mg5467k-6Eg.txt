You would think that the Scottsdale or Tempe TJ Maxx locations have the best selection but that's not always the case. I've found some high end designer accessories that I rarely see at any of the other locations.  I've bought a couple pairs of Ralph Lauren Purple Label sunglasses for $40.00. Not bad considering these are usually priced at around $350 - $400 MSRP. Also picked up a Under Armour golf bag for $29.95 which run around $120.00 at Sports Authority. Also, for men's grooming products, you can't go wrong. I can always find some Zirh skin care products for  $5.99 - which is a steal.  Definitely worth a look.

I'm a huge Puma nerd, and sometimes they have awesome deals on it. A friend showed me the deals to be had at TJmaxx and Ross a few years, and I got to say there's always something..

There are really good bargains to be discovered here. This location is always clean and organized.  Even during holiday shopping season, this store is kept up well. The staff is friendly and are quick to assist if you need help.

This TJ Maxx consistently has a great selection of purses.  Shoes, not so much.

This is my favorite TJ MAXX in the East Valley. As the other reviews say, it is clean, organized, and  well stocked. Don't forget to check the clearance sections.
