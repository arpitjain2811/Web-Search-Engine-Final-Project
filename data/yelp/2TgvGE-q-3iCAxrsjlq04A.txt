Great spot near us to let Dolce run around...The field in this park is huge, and there's also a concrete walkway circling the field if you feel like taking a stroll. During the Summer months, there is a water park section for the kids and a few picnic tables as well. A great place for the families and their furry friends...ALOHA!!!

This place has it all. Jogging/walking trail, water feature for kids, playground, huge open field, shuffle board, picnic tables and it is never over populated shhhh.  I enjoy bringing my pom pom here and he gets extremely exited as soon as we pull up to the parking lot.
