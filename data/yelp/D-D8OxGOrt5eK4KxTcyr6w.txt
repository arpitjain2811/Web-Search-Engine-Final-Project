Friendly service. The food looks fresh and tasty. They get you in and out quite quickly. Clean establishment.  They also have a few tables to sit at or you can carry it out. They also cater.

I really like this subway! They are all very nice. Everytime I go in I see someone cleaning, which makes me feel confident that the restaurant is hygienic. They aren't stingy with the veggies which I love! I make the choice to come here instead of the other subway down the street.

this'll be a lackluster review, but what can I say about one of the most popular sandwich chains?  Their breakfast deals are one of the best, and I wish they had a drive-thru here to make it more accessible. A flat bread sandwich and a coffee or drink for $3 is something that can't be beat.  Get it!
