Lena is the best! A great cut for around $20. Got a shoe shine while I waited too! I've been coming here for over 4 years and would recommended it to anyone.

Lena did a fantastic job, for a price that is better than anywhere else in Scottsdale. This is definitely where I will be going from now on.   It's hard to find a place to get a quality mens haircut and shave with a straight razor, but Mercado Ranch Barber Shop does it very well.

Everything I expected and a great price. It was a hair-cut I am happy with and cost under $20. I will be going back from now on.

Great haircut, great service and great prices! Lena has been cutting my hair now for about 8 years and I couldn't be happier. It is normal to be apprehensive about trying a new barber. Don't be. With Lena at Mercado Ranch Barber Shop, your hair will look better than you ever believed possible. I don't know how she does it. But she does. No need to look any further. This is the best place to get a haircut. I promise you.

I have been going to Lena for Years! Most of  the time I make an appointment, as she is very Busy! She gives a great haircut and style for women. . I have short hair which is hard to cut, but I always leave there with a GREAT look!!!
