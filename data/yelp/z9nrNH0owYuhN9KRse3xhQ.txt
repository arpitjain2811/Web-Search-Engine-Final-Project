HORRIBLE !!!!! don't waste your money here ! i went in for a haircut and got out with my hair looking horrible, it's cheap but you pay for what you get. Horrible place. at least this salon.

The place I normally get my haircut was closed, so needed to find a place I could get a quick trim in the area I was in. Found this place and before I even sat down in the waiting area, they called my name. Great service and happy with the trim!

The lady who did my little boys hair did great! He was a little wiggle worm and a bit of a screamer (his first time) and she handled it wonderfully! Will be back for sure!
