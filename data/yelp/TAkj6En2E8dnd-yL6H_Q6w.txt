Good food but could be spicier. Just dumping on the sriracha and sambar Orleans isn't what I was looking for.  It's good and not expensive, so go for it.

Of the three Pho Dau Bo's, this is the worst.    Incredibly inconsistent from visit to visit. 1/2 the time food is not very hot, meat is either overcooked or reheated and tough. The other two are by far better. Really enjoy Pho Dau Bo
