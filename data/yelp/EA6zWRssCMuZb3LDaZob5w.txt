This is a drinkers bar. It's got plenty of TVs, a juke box, Golden Tee machines, pool tables and some couches to relax on to watch the games. NY Yankee fans will give this place 8 stars. No food here so I gave it 3.

Hole in the wall... but cool.  I was there years ago and watched some of the best local musicians jam.  It was incredible.  I hear they still like to drop in but when I was there it was quiet.  Just a quick stop to see what's new.  Reasonably comfortable, gambling (video poker/keno), etc.

Not a fan. They had a karaoke night for a short time about a year or two ago, but every time the owner was in, the host had to turn the music down...almost to the point of not needing a microphone. if you want a quiet bar, don't have a karaoke night. I love dive bars, but this place was just seedy.
