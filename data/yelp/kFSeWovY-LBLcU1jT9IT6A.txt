Incredible deals on upscale ready-to-wear clothing with couture detailing. They carry Carlisle, Etcetera, Per Se and Eccoci brands as well as some shoes and a new men's line. Fabrics are usually natural - merino wool, silk, cotton blends. In the Carlisle and Per Se lines, seams are bound, as are button holes. Everything is lined and the designs are very NYC meets Europe chic. Unlike anything you'll find in Vegas. I LOVE this store!

I had never heard of this store until I visited the Town Square Las Vegas shopping mall.  It appears to carry high-priced women's clothing.  The styles seemed more mature to my liking, so I didn't stay in here for too long.  The salewoman did happen to ask me if I knew how to operate a price gun.  She must have really been in a pinch!

The town center location is run horribly. I'm not sure what is going on in this place but its actually uncomfortable to shop there. The store layout is horrible, there are almost no mirrors, and the staff seems to have some type of underlying competitive nature perhaps they are on commission, which is silly because items are very cheap there. Sizing is all over the place.  In and out ASAP.
