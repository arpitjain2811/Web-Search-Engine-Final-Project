Beautiful views.  Nice menu.  Had lunch on patio.  Loved that it was not crowded with a hundred tables crammed in.  Could enjoy the desert and conversations with friends.  I'll go again.

Cute place with some nice views. The breakfast menu is small and nothing outstanding, everything was good and our waitress Lia was wonderful. The bacon was crisp and the waffles were tasty. The sausage links were nicely cooked and the portions were perfectly sized. Overall a positive experience.
