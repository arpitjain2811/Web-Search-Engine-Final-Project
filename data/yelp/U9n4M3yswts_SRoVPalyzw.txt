I was in a car accident and my insurance Progressive, secured a rental with Enterprise. When I arrived through the door, I was greeted by a huge smile and very polite Jeremy .  He asked if I was there to rent or return. I soberly told him that my insurance had called for me.  He perked up and said "Sharman?"  I was a little surprised.. "yes!"  he pulled out keys and paperwork that was already completed and all I had to do was sign. THAT EASY!  I went out to a new toyota corolla, completely loaded... and drove away. AWESOME service...
