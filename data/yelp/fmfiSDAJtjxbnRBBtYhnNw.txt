Buffalo chicken was excellent!  Taco was great and the kids had the mammas. Outside seating was perfect on such a nice day.

We went here for a dinner celebrating our Twin girls birthday.  It was a very nice space, setup similar to a Noodles and Company.  The specialty is mac n' cheese and they have many variations.   The food was delicious, without a doubt. The windows were really bright though and we found ourselves sweating from the setting sun pouring into the west facing windows.  The manager told us shades were on the way. Highly Recommended and we will visit again.

Great lunch spot near Costco and target.  We tried the buffalo chicken as well as momma's Mac & cheese,  both were very good.  Open and airy location and they bring your meals to you if you are dining in. We will return to try more things including the four cheese melt which I'm told is excellent.

First time I stopped I got it to go.  I opened it as soon as I got to my car and it was Luke warm.  Tasmte wise it was good but I like my macNcheese warmer.  The second time here I had the Popeye with spinach, mushroom and onion.  We ate at a table and everything was piping hot.  Husband had the buffalo chicken and loved it.  He isn't a Mac and cheese type of guy but he said he would ce back.  Three kids had the regular child's Mac and cheese with hi milk, chips and apple slices.  Everyone cleaned their plate except my husband who ordered the papa size Mac and cheese.

Tried this restaurant for the first time tonight. For some reason, we thought it would be similar to Noodles & Company. Our food was okay but it seemed overpriced for the portion size. Probably won't go back.
