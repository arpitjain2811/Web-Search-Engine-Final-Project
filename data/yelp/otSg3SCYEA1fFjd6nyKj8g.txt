If you need anything for martial arts this place is it. Friendly and knowledgable staff. The owner knows just about everyone in the martial arts community. Heck he knew all my past instructors (not sure if he knows my current instructor, he probably knows him) lol. Uniforms, they carry all types and weights (from lightweight to heavy weight). If you want to your kicks and hand techniques to sound awesome, buy the heavyweight uniform. The prices are very reasonable and they will go above and beyond the call of duty. Weapons, they carry just about everything. Shoes, posters...all martial arts, all everything about martial arts.

Poor customer service. I called to ask what time they were closing, he said 7p. It was only 6:50pm, he stated he was closing up, I told him I was on my way. He then replied he had already "cashed out". I even stated I was buying a gift. It didnt seem to matter to him. I guess imma stick with Amazon & eBay.
