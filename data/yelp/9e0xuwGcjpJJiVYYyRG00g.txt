I prefer this Fry's over the one at Ellsworth and Broadway. This one has a nice Deli, Bakery, and the produce is awesome! I am not happy with the butcher since they told me no point in getting the fresh sausage, just get the packaged since it was on sale. Why would I ask for fresh than?  The store is clean, but I don't like the fact that the people who sweep always seems to make you fee like YOU are in their way?! I think they need to sweep around us not the opposite.  Love DOUBLE COUPONS up to $1.00. LOVE the idea that prices are lower than most local stores on a lot of items.

I love coming here. The staff is knowledgeable. Stewart was amazing and knowledge about the power bars and other items in the health section of the store. The Meat department will let you taste the meats before buying. Bakery is awesome at explaining flavors and making cakes look awesome! This place might be pennies more then winco but the service is well worth more then a few pennies. Love this place. It's also 24 hours and allow dogs in. As long as their in carts during the summer. Which is a huge plus!
