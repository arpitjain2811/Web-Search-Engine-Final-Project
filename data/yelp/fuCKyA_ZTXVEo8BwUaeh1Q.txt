I just wanna know why  is it that everytime I go outside of the Bay Area I always get the option of pepper jack cheese?!?!?! Don't they know that's what makes the sandwich?!?!? But I thank and LOVE those that do!! Team Pepper Jack cheese! :)

Prices were higher than the ones here in SD and the sandwich wasn't that good.. I actually got a 6 inch and I only finished about 1/2 of it and had to throw the rest away. Soda refills were NOT FREE! wth??? kinda ridiculous...

I stopped in for a breakfast sandwich which is normally $3.25 at every other subway I have visited. Here it was $6. Absolutely insane. The sand which was fine-nothing special (is it ever at subway?)  and the staff were kinda rude when I asked why the price was so much more vs everywhere else.
