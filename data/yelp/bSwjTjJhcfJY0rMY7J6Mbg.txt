I went here for a birthday party, and I actually thought it was a fun bar. It's just a little dive bar, but they have pool, a boxing machine, and karaoke, so no lack of entertainment. The drinks were also fairly good and the bartender was really efficient, which was great! So it sounds like it should be a higher review, right? Well the reason it's not is that when we all got our bills they seemed very high, especially for a dive bar. In addition, the bills weren't itemized, so you couldn't figure out which drinks were so expensive in order to avoid them next time. My other problem was that the karaoke host ignored my BF's song request for like 2 hours... but that's kind of his fault because he didn't go ask him about it. Can't really blame the bar for that.  So I would say, go to this bar, but don't expect any deals because apparently looks are deceiving.
