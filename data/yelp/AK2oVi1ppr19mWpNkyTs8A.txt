I guess I just felt like having expensive ice cream for some reason and I stopped in here. The service was okay but it took unusually long to make my order.

Holy smokes, you want how much for ice cream?  Then again, you're looking at a guy that just buys vanilla and if I get a little bored, squirt some Hersheys Syrup in it and mix it up.  I guess the ice cream is good, but when I can go and buy a steak at the grocery store for the same cost, every bite I sit and imagine that I could instead be eating a ribeye cooked at home. Another thing occurred to me, what would it look like for someone to be an ice cream kneader if they werent high school aged?  Well maybe it would work if it were an older guy with a handlebar mustache.
