We went to the pond where there's ducks and a park.  Tried to get a bit of fresh air since the weather was finally cooling down.  It's really pretty, but it was a little difficult to have a picnic there since they had no tables and chairs.  The side walk and grass were filthy from all of the duck poop, so we had to be careful where we sat.  The park area was nice.  Overall, some maintenance would work.

I loved my visit here. It's beautiful, with geese and ducks. People fish here (catch and release), feed the birds and take walks in the area.  Sunsets are gorgeous over the water.

Nice place to come down to with the kids or just for a nice stroll along the water. Sometimes you'll have hoards of ducks, geese try and hassle you for a bite to eat but all in all not to bad. They have a nice open area with beach, basketball court and BBQ area for you to relax
