I just had a great experience with Lance at Thunderbird Computer Consulting.   My home computer had been out of commission for the past 2 days with a virus/trojan.  It was a complete mess and for all I tried I couldn't get the problem solved on my own.  I called Lance and he came out the next day and had my computer clean within an hour.  I'm so thankful! He was efficient, friendly and inexpensive.  I would highly recommend him.

With 5 young adults in my home, we have had our share of "computer emergencies"! Lance has been our go to guy for over 5 years. He knows his stuff,  is reliable and reasonable in charges. Most important he is honest and trustworthy.
