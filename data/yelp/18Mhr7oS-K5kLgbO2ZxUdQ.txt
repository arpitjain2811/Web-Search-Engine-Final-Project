This an okay indoor soft play. Biggish with some cool trampolines and a chill-out sensory room. It has a somewhat dog-eared appearance and is in a slightly rough and out of the way area, as many of the larger indoor soft plays tend to be. It does seem clean and there is a little cafe for chips and tea and so on. Where it slightly falls down is the client√®le can be a bit rough. The kids can sometimes be wild and the parents are either totally uninterested in making sure their cherubs are not re-enacting Lord Of The Flies in a hidden corner OR they are actually coming to blows about exactly the same issue. I have seen two mums threaten to batter each other over this. I don't think you should let this put you off but it is something to be aware of. If you see a child behaving badly, tell the attendant at the front desk rather than approach the child or the parent. It's a good place with a few cautions and the prices are quite good.
