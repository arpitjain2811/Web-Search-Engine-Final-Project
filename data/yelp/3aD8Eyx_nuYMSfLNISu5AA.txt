Fast and easy! I went in yesterday to get my notary stamp, she suggested two different stamps and I choose the higher ended one/longer lasting one. I went in around 3pm yesterday and they called me at 830am this morning to tell me it was ready. Prices seem reasonable and comparable to what is online. Overall, I will be recommending this place to anyone who needs a stamp.

Las Vegas Rubber Stamp is the BEST place in town to get a custom stamp made. Not only is their pricing very competitive, but their turn around time can not be beat. I showed up at 4:50 in the afternoon (they close at 5) to order a new notary stamp, and they had it ready for pick up by 10 am the following day... And there was no extra charge to expedite the job.  Highly recommended.
