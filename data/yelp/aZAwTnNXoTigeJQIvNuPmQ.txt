My wife went to this Salon and did her hair with the sweetest most professional lady she has ever worked with.  I believe her name was Ghada.  My wife said the style, the cut and the color was the best she has ever had.  And I actually noticed it this time! :).  She has gone to so many places to find the right blend and color for her highlights, and Ghada was able to mix and match perfectly.  She said the salon itself belongs in Vegas practically, because it is very upscale and clean and the entire experience was very enjoyable.  My wife usually says that she goes to places and does not get the attention to detail like she did with Ghada.  She said she wishes she went to Ghada a long time ago.  She and I highly recommend this salon and Ghada specifically.
