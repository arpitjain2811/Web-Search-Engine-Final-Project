Never again! Apparently they make you show up an hour early, only to leave you waiting an additional 2 hours for a 10 minute spine injection. So, my appointment was at 3pm, I didnt leave until 5:30pm! They didnt even take me in until 5pm!  I was there over 3 hours for something that took the dr 10 whole minutes! Plus you cant eat 6 hours before so you are just left to starve because they are over 2 hours behind schedule. Not to mention the injections offered me no relief. Waste of time, waste of money.

I've never written a review but as far as time waiting it's pretty good maybe 15 min in waiting room then up to 30 or depending on your condition once you are in with nurse and PA combined. If you go to surgery center, I've been called in early because they were ahead of schedule. I've never waited in surgery for shots more than 20 maybe once. Most of time I'm back there with IV in 20 min from time I walk in the door. I've done epidural so for a year in 2011 then radio nuerotonomy this yr. Dr Burkhead is a great Dr and good bed side manner. All nurses are good starting IV the first time every time. Pam and Val are great at Summerlin location. Overall I am pleased with their service.-Bryan USAF
