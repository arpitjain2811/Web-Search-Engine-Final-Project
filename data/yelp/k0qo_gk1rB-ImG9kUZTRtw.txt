I love getting the Mango Chicken Salad! Its fast and fresh! I like that.

Pretty decent food here, reminded me of Chipotle a little. Too many onions and green peppers in the burrito I ordered, but I liked the freshness of everything, as well as the outdoor seating. They need more umbrellas or shade, as there was not enough seating outside for other customers that also didn't want to eat in direct sunlight.

Great manager and staff at this location!  Takes a few minutes for  the orders, but that's because it's all made fresh and you can sure taste the difference. Grilled Mahi Tacos are awesome.  Great salsa bar with the best jalapenos!  Could use a few options without cilantro for Gringos though :).

Great place to go when I need a quick and healthy lunch.  I get the Baja salad w/ mahi on it. Healthy green lettuce.  Lots of fish. Dressing on the side.  I also enjoy the ahi tacos.  Great lunch deal.

Just stopped by this location yesterday and it was completely empty!  Checked their website and the location here and the one one FLW isn't listed either.  The closest one to Scottsdale is at 7th Street and Bell.  Did a franchisee go under?

Another Groupon casualty!  I bought several Groupons for this location and used only one.  Then we went to go use another one the other day and *BAM* it's gone!  Another one bites the dust. Return Factor - An obvious 0%.
