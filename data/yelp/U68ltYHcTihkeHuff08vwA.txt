If you're looking for wine... a lot of wine, then Great Grog is the place to go. While the name may not be the most appealing, the superb selection of wines on offer will certainly be enticing. In addition to an excellent range they also have superb offers which change frequently so you are more than likely to get a barg' or two... or three. Whether it's a single bottle for a night in or a huge supply of wine for a party of event, Great Grog will accommodate all of your needs.

As you probably know, Edinburgh can be quite upmarket compared to other similarly sized cities, and the proliferation of wine shops or "vintners" as I think is the correct term, is perhaps a sign of this. It seems to permeate even to the tramps, as I've noticed discarded bottles of Blossom Hill both in the alcove at Fleshmarket Close and outside Waverley steps. A couple of weeks ago I was also asked for spare change by a hobo who was both better spoken and more smartly dressed than myself. Anyway, I digress, Edinbuggers love their wine, and while this store isn't in itself the most upmarket or well stocked, the fantastic pirate-themed name always makes me smile. Aar.

You'll find a great selection of wines from around the world.  I don't know how or why, but I can get very good Aussie and Kiwi wines here around the A$20 a bottle mark for Â£10-12 a bottle...its cheaper here in the UK than if I buy it from a shop just up the road from the winery itself in Oz???  Well, actually, I do know why...it's cos the Aussie Gov't whack such a ridiculously large excise on alcohol...but I digress.  The guys who work here know their stuff and are more than happy to impart their knowledge on you, if so requested. A really good, well priced and friendly shop!
