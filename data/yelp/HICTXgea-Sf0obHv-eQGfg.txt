A friend of mine recently got hitched and she asked me to be her bridesmaid, woo!  She stayed the night at this hotel and I came bright and early the next day for hair/makeup and mimosas:)  This place is quite snazzy, with its chic decor and great complimentary breakfast.  The breakfast wasn't your typical bowl of overripe apples and a box of frosted flakes, no no, they had a waffle iron, eggs, bagels, oatmeal, juices, milk, coffee, English muffins, yogurt, etc.  Quite impressive.  The room was nice, my friend said she thought the bed was a little firm for her liking, but otherwise nice.  The only downside was that during our wedding makeovers, the water stopped working.  As in, no toilet flushing or washing of hands.  When you have seven women in one room with flowing champagne, that's not a good thing.  The front desk was more than helpful, however, and opened up several rooms next to us and a few downstairs, too.  Thanks for the hospitality!

this place has seen better days. perhaps it used to be nicer, but it isn't anything special now. the rooms are ok, but the beds and furniture are somewhat worn. they just underwent a minor renovation, but it appears it wasn't enough. i have since discovered  there are better deals, and nicer hotels right off the same exit.

I have stayed here a few times.  Rooms and facilities are clean and friendly staff.  Beds are really comfy and rooms decent size.  Nice location close to freeway.  I like these better than adjacent motels.
