Hey, it's the club with a nice restaurant on the side inside your mall. You look around inside and you could swear that you're in NYC and not LV. Well, it's a great mixture of both. Lovely wait staff, and energetic bartenders. The one dance floor gets crazy only after 1AM. VIP table service is solid--though not as omnipresent as that at Pure. Oh, and the food at the restaurant is fine too.

This club is a nice looking club, newly opened, empty, terribly promoted.
