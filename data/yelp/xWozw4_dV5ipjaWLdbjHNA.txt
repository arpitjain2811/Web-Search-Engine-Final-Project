I really love Marks and Spencer's food, they produce high quality things in really high quality packaging. Not that the packaging really matters... This particular Marks and Spencer is just for food, and is the perfect size. The aisles are wide enough for 2 or even 3 people to pass comfortably and everything is laid out clearly. Unlike most other Marks and Spencer's in Edinburgh, this one is never really too busy so it's a nice experience rather than a stressful one. If you ever need or fancy food shopping in Marks and Sparks, this is the one to come to.
