This shopping center has a little bit of almost everything...functional shopping (clothes, food, home improvement), food, drinking, entertainment, etc. The only thing it doesn't have that I think it should is a gas station. The closest gas station or convenience store is out on Alma School and 8th. Not a HUGE inconvenience, but it could be misleading the first time you go.

This sleepy shopping center has some good places to go. The Cinemark here smells weird, but you can count on the fact that there won't be any crowds.

I will avoid Tempe Marketplace like the plague if I can find a comparable store/restaurant/movie time at this location.  I love it.  Easy parking, great layout, excellent variety of shops and services.
