This is a good fishmonger in the heart of the West End.  A good array of filleted fish (some whole, trout & salmon mostly), mussels, scallops and prawns. The majority of the shellfish has been thawed from frozen (as you'll find just about anywhere these days), however quite a lot of the fillets are fresh. You can also buy frozen if it suits your needs. I have been in many times now and have been more than happy with both their fish and shellfish - their uncooked king prawns (sourced from Spain) are of excellent quality and size (avg 12-14 prawns / kg) and given the quality, reasonably priced (about Â£14/kg).
