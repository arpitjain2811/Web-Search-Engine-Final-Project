Misled by Ortho about NO CO-Payment. They lied to my wife & after many  visits sent her a bill . Rest assured we will never go there again. their service also leaves a lot to be desired.

After going to another PT spot (Close Physical Therapy) I found Orthosport Physical Therapy.  Jeff made time to eval me on a day his schedule was already full.  Chris, the outgoing assistant, started me on an exercise regiment.  Jeff was upfront that I would get better but 1) plan to work hard and 2) plan to be there at least an hour and a half every visit.  He's not kidding.  My normal visits are about 2 hours with Chris supervising exercises.  Jeff (and the other PT Tony) make sure they are involved with the stretching of each of their patients every trip.  The office girls Ellen and Alicia have been very accomodating with scheduling and with collecting copays on a weekly bases.  They also let me know right away if we do not have authorization for a visit so we can cancel.  While it has been a long process to come back from an accident, the support that I get from Orthosport is second to none!
