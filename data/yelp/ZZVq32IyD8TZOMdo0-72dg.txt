Panda Express... It's a guilty pleasure. Once in a while I'll crave their orange chicken & chow mein. Doesn't matter what anyone says... It's not authentic and blah blah. I don't care. Sometimes I just want Pandas orange chicken & chow mein and Panda will always deliver.

Well..... Don't ask for pot stickers when they don't have any because they will be red about it when you ask. Oh and if your debit card doesn't run through because you use it too much and it's a little worn b prepared to have cash because they won't even try to type your number in.
