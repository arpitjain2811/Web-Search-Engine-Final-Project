Used to have amazing staff, but they all left over 'irreconcilable differences' with the new staff (manager maybe?). Now they are understaffed and the wait is usually long. Wait at the post office is much shorter, shockingly!

The only positive and knowledgeable person at this store is Chris (male) not the female Manager Chris. I truly wonder how this location survives due to all the inconsistencies an lack of communication. I had to file a claim due to their lack of properly packaging my gift item and now a month later its still no where. I will now start to using the Ray Road location. STAY AWARE FROM CHANDLER LOCATION! Chris (male) transfer to a different location it will benefit you tremendously!!!

Say they open at 8am...sitting here at 10 after and locked/shuttered. Can't open on time?

They always have am active Yelp/Foursquare special running at this location. It saves you money where other locations don't. Go see Dan!

Had the most unprofessional and rude experience ever at a packaging store. Stephanie has to know her actions will not be tolerated by decent people. Wrote a detailed complaint to their management, still waiting for a response. That type of behavior has no place in a professionally run business. It's 2014 not the 1800's.
