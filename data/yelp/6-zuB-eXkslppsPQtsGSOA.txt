This is a nice place to grab a quick & healthy bite or drink after your workout at Warrior Fitness Center.  It's one of the healthier choices on base.  It rarely gets too busy, so the seemingly small cafe has ample room to sit & eat.  Prices are reasonable, and the menu is small but adequate.  They'd probably make more money by selling individual-sized servings of nutritional supplements instead of the whole container (catering to infrequent users, more budget-minded exercisers and people who just forgot to bring or take their nutrients before coming to the gym).  The staff is friendly and helpful; I haven't had a bad experience yet.  It's not the best fitness/gym cafe I've ever seen, but it's very clean, the staff are nice and the food/drinks are good.

I like this place for a quick meal on my lunch hour or post work out. Plenty of seating, small menu but it's generally shakes, what more do you want?  It's really affordable too.

Mango and Dreams!! Best shake out here, other than the Harlem!
