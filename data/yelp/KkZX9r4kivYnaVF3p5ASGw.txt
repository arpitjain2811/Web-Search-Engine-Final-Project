Horrible place.  I threw a party for work in Vegas and had to get some brochures printed here.  I will never use this place again.  They over charged, provided poor quality printing services and wouldn't refund us for their bad work.   These people changed out the expensive paper I asked for with cheap paper and tried to tell me that no one could tell the difference anyway.  Well, I paid for the expensive paper and I could tell the difference and so could our clients. I'll go anywhere but here in the future.

I've had good service from Tom at Arrowhead for years.  Good quality, service and reasonable.  He delivers to me, too.

Ordered some business cards in a pinch. Steve was very polite and professional in accommodating my needs. They were great with the design and the end product was exactly as promised. I would highly recommend them to anyone with any printing needs. Would definitely use again.
