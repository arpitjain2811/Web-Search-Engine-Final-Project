Liked the Doctor but beware of their billing practices.  I went to this doctor and then a year later they are trying to bill for monies that were paid by my medical insurance. Also they never contacted me stating that any monies were owed to them.  No statements, letters or phone call NOTHING!  Next thing I know I was surprised by a notice from my credit monitoring service that they placed a negative report on my credit report.  After investigating this debt I called my insurance company and found that this was paid to the doctor and now the doctor is in violation of their insurance contract by trying to bill for additional monies.   BEWARE this doctors office is a credit nightmare!
