Dr. Patrick is an exceptional dentist. He is a perfectionist and genuinely cares for his patients. My husband and I experienced this first hand. Having had 2 new crowns recently (which can be very expensive), we found Desert Oasis pricing to be very competitive.  Dr. Patrick always has a positive attitude and makes you feel comfortable. It is SO worthwhile to go to a dentist you can trust. Additionally, the office is beautiful and the staff is always pleasant and professional.
