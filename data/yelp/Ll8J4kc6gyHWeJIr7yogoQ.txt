Many after school snacks are found at the Grocery Station. Boars Head sandwiches (can't find those everywhere, and never at corner grocers!) and a good selection of chips, energy bars, beer, etc.  The service is great - fast and friendly. Always a smile and friendly conversation... not some creepy guy behind the counter. What else could you want for a corner grocery shop?  Would be 5 stars if there was a small selection of fresh fruit, veggies, or something like that. That's all that's missing!

Great spot. For a mini market, they have a solid beer and wine selection.  I ride my bike here all the time to pick up a sandwich. I have been hooked on the beefstrami for weeks. They always run a solid daily sandwich special. Full sandwich, chips, small side and drink for under $7. I recommend any sandwich you get on a sub roll.  While you wait, you can play some scratchers, or bs with the guys behind the counter. Sure beats the hell out of subway! I'm thankful to have this establishment in the neighborhood. Support it!

Great neighborhood corner market. Great beer selection and the owners (and all the employees) are all very nice. One of my favorite spots in this neighborhood. Great sandwiches too!
