Great Dentist, been going there for 6 years with the entire family and have had no regrets, the staff is awesome, place is beautiful and they work very hard to make going to the dentist as pleasant as it can be. Great flexibility with insurance and money management.  Dr Nitu genuilly cares about your teeth and is not there to get rich, a great professional who cares about his patients.

Great facility, great staff!  Digital x-rays. Crowns made on site in about an hour so no waiting or dealing with a temp.  Prices are more than affordable.  I was impressed with Dr. Nitu's knowledge and friendliness. His staff is engaging and very competent. My cleaning was fast and painless. I cannot imagine using anyone else for my general dentistry needs.

My father- in - law asked me to share his wonderful experience at this office. He loved the comfortable chairs and the staff were amazing. But most amazing was the fact that his treatment was painless. The Dr. was so very gentle.
