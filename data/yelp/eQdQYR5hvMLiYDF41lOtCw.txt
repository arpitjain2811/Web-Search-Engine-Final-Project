From my one time visit...... Person who took my order spoke less English than a Swahili immigrant. It was annoying. Food was luke warm and the string beans were very wilted. Only good part was the awesome Mt. Dew they had on tap.   I would advise a different Panda Express.

Still sucks, and YELP is still biased! Why do I bother.

Service sucks, tiny portions, WAY OVER PRICED! Will not return.
