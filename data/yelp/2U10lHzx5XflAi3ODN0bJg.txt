Only reason why I don't give them 5stars is because I had to drive around looking for them since they didn't update their address then they are still in the middle of remodeling so it was really hard to find them or couldn't even tell if they were open or not so it was a bit confusing for me but, service n selection wise they were great and the price? I went in there after doing research so i had my budget and i think they saved me at least $400 on things I got that I would've paid a lot more at other places in town and Tony was awesome and very helpful ;)

belinda the store manager helped us so much when we were buying supplies for our restaurant. if you need anything go talk to her. they have a lot of used equipment for really great prices. if youre also thinking about running a food truck they have parking places and use of a fridge and kitchen for prep on their premise. i dont know the exact details and price to use them but definitely talk to belinda. i could spend hours looking around in there.

I walked in planning on only buying one thing and walked out with multiple. This place had so many things its ridiculous. I bought an apron, a pizza cutter, micro blade, dough scrapper and a pastry brush for less than 20 bucks!! You can't beat that. All chefs and home cooks alike will fall on love with this place.

This place has it all!  If you are willing to search through shelves full of repurposed goodies, you are certain to go home with that prized item that your bar or kitchen could not do without. And you will certainly be the only person who has one of those. They envy of all your house guests! When you have a couple of hours, come in and have fun. Ask for help and be sure to buy. Because you will regret it later if you don't.
