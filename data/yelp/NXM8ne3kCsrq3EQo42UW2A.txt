I felt like chicken mcnuggets one day after shopping.  So on the way home, I decide to through the drive thur to get my lunch and something for the hubby too. 10 McNuggets - OMG, they were HARD not crispy Quarter Pound with cheese - Ok, the buns were a little hard McDouble with cheese - Hubby, same taste and the bun was soft Fries are GOOD! Do not know if it is this location or an off day for McD's.
