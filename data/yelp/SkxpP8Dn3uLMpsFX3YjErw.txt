This is where I go to get my hair cut. Always a good place, staff are friendly and they keep track of your haircuts so you can just say "The same as last time" and any of the stylists can do it. Its also my favorite because when I say "High and tight" I dont have to explain it..

I normally go to a different sports clips, but I was in the area so I came to this one.  It's 3 days before Christmas, and this place is packed.  But the girls seem more interested in chatting and opening gifts rather than cutting hair.  The loud, high pitched squeals belong in a salon, not a place intended for men's haircuts.  I'm currently walking out the door to head back to my normal place.

Large screen tv in the lobby and each stylist station has a large screen tv.  Only sporting events are on while getting a haircut.  Good quality cut from friendly staff.

Back to this location following my move to the west side.  Brook is the manager and she is A++ stylist and 5 stars for being such a friendly girl too. Sports + TV screen in every chair = #guyswin
