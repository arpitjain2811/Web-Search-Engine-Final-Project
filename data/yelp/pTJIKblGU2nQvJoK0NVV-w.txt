I hate to say it, but I liked this place better than Ned's crazy sub. I have been going to Ned's since I was a little kid.

This place was filthy!  Food prep area, walls, floors, worst off- the ice tea container. GROSS

Steves crazy subs is a DIVE but it has amazing subs, the best in az. I suggest take out because this place is filthy.
