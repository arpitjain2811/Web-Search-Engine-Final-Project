I like the actual doctors visits. The doctors however, prescribe the latest prescriptions that require prior authorizations. This practice does not like completing the insurance paperwork.  I really have a low opinion of them because of this.

BEST DOCTORS, BEST STAFF. I have been going to FPN for 5 years now I will never switch my neurologist. My MS has been helped so much. I recommend FPN to anyone. Thee is a wait though but it is worth every single minute. It is safe to say that you will receive the same amount of attention that you want and need.
