The foot massage was great, but not a five star due to needing a bit more oil. They were super kind to get us in late in the evening and take care of me and my hubby for his birthday eve! We will be back in town in February and will probably have to go again!

Great place, great service. This was a spur of the moment to just go get a foot massage for my boyfriend and I. We enjoyed every minute. The staff was friendly and polite. We will be back soon.

Went here with my friend today.. It was both of our first experiences at any foot spa. It was awesome didn't realize you got a full body massage. The place was relaxing, clean and very friendly service. It's my new Spot for sure,,,
