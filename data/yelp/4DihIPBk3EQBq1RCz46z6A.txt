I love coming to this store, they have lots of affordable selection and most of all its very clean, organized  and brightly light.  Even thought the strip mall its located in isn't the prettiest.  David is really helpful with helping folks pick out hair pieces; that is if you're not too sure of yourself and need a honest truthful response. I've been coming here on and off for 2 years now and rarely have I ever walked out disappointed.

It's not LA but it will do perfectly! We stopped in for some African American beauty supplies for my sister and I. Told her about the soaps and the creams. She stocked up till her next visit. Nice store with lots to offer. I will be back to buy more!

I enjoy the the variety of high quality hair Hair Plus provides! By far the BEST place to purchase decent hair! The Motions products keep increasing in price though!! (Walmart is cheaper)
