In the first time, I had a new experience with classic mani. They did more carefully. Before starting, they asked me the detail of what I expected. It was not the same to other salon. They also take their time to ensure I was absolutely satisfied. I found a bit mistake and required to fix it, They did it with enthusiastically. Highly recommed and definitely be back!

Great service. Make reservations, they do take walk ins but they are so popular you may wait. Worth it though!
