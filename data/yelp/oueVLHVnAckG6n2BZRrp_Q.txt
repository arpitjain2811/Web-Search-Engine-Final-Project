Dr. Harvey Chin has been my dentist for almost 8yrs now.  Flexible scheduling, nice office and great saff.  If you're new in town and need a dentist, I would recommend this one.

I had a very bad experience With this dentist he seems nice but  his work is awful He put a new crown 3 root canals on the same tooth for 2 weeks I was tasting a very strong chemical coming out of my tooth and can't still chew on I  Had to go to different dentist to fix my tooth. Stay away from this Dentist. He should not be practicing.
