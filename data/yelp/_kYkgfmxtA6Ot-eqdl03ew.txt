I recently bought a lamb fur throw during my visit to Vegas and very pleased with it. The owner took a lot of his time to help me make my selection. Appreciate it. I would recommend this store to anyone looking for premium alpaca and lamb fur made products.

Amazing store and Ken was also awesome and very helpful. I bought many products ranging from rugs to even gloves, and every time that I came here, I felt welcomed and had an amazing experience. If you want anything made with alpaca wool, this is the best store to come to.
