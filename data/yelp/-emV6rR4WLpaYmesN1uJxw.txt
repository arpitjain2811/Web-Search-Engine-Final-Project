I abbbbsoollluuuttteeelllyyyy LOVE Amy! I used to get facials from her when she worked at a different salon. She is the only person that I let touch my face. I'm so glad that she is at Icon now. I recommend her to EVERYONE.

I have had 3 body scrubs and 5 facials from Amy. She totally had me relaxed. Her spa room at Icon is very soothing relaxing atmosphere!

Amy is amazing! She is the one person in this city that I trust with my Brazilian waxes. She is kind, friendly, accommodating and most importantly makes you feel very comfortable. Her prices are also extremely reasonable. Icon Spa is lucky to have such an amazing esthetician working in their facility. If you're looking for a clean, comfortable, relaxing, painless and overall amazing experience call and book an appointment with Amy! :)

Two days before my wedding I went to Amy for a Brazilian. I heard how painful they were, so understandably I was a bit nervous, as this was my first. The atmosphere was so peaceful and relaxing. She had me laughing and completely at ease. There was NO PAIN!!!!!! I won't go to anyone else!
