Although the resort was nice, we were severely disappointed in the customer service.  You would think that paying good money for a timeshare would result in a little more attention from the staff.  We complained and the resort manager did offer us a few nights stay for free, however since this place is a 6 hour drive for us I don't know that we will ever be able to use it.  We appreciate him trying to make is right, which is why I won't give them only 1 star.

The place is pretty nice so that's not my beef. The service sucks sucks sucks. Over priced for the wrong service and they will not refund anything. Go elsewhere.
