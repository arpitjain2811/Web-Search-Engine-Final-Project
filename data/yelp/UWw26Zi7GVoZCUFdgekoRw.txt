Great Sandwiches, get outta here subway.  I've only tried the cold subs, but I tried it, then brought my 2 roommates, and we all agree the food is great.  I recommend the Smokey cheddar on any sandwich, its great. They slice the meat and cheese right in front of you.  Fresh and Tasty. Enjoy!

My favorite sammy restaurant chain of all time. I always get the #5 on sourdough... MMM MMM MMM. Great customer service there, only downer is the outdated interior... always a To Go order when ordering from the Boulder Hwy. location. But they are doin' something right! It's always pretty busy in there!

Love this place.  Every time I visit family in Henderson, I have to get my Port of Subs fix.  I dream about their sandwiches all year long....that's how good they are.  Love the #5.  It has come to the point of obsession because anytime I travel, I always look up if Port of Subs is in the area.   Wish there was one where I live.

Tomatoes looked disgusting and why don't they carry ketchup? Isn't this America? I hope this microwaved breakfast griller tastes good...
