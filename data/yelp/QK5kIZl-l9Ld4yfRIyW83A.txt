My daughter and I had mani/pedis here today. I got gel polish and she had a design done her nails. They did a fantastic job!  Everyone was super nice. Would definitely go again.

I went here with my mom for two deluxe spa pedicures and it was really nice. The staff was friendly and the environment was welcoming. It's kind of hard to notice at first within Westgate, but it was a great experience and I definitely recommend it!

A great place for a mani pedi...  And JoJo applies the most magnificent lashes.  They look beautiful and last a long time.  And prices are reasonable. Next time you are at Westgate, leave time for pampering!
