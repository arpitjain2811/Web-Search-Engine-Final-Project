This is good pizza!  My roommate and I love this place.  The toppings are fresh and delish! They also have great fried zucchini, and starter salads.  Just fresh and no messing around.  And the people who work here are super nice!   I would highly recommend this place! Eat up!   My only gripe is that they close kinda early (I think by 8 pm).

I really liked this place. Sadly, it's closed now. Hope they reopen somewhere.
