Horrible horrible horrible service! They are liars and they are out to scam you! Be very careful when dealing with them! They lied about amount and would not take responsibibility. The manager said he couldnt listen to the recording until the next day and ionce he did if the girl who helped me on the phone was wrong he would yell at her but not honor  what she promised us. The guy who came to the site, scared my 60 year old mother threading her that he would call alll of vegas, so no one would help us if we didn't give him the business. I was 8 months pregnant and he was sitting there arguing with me, I didn't need this at the time. I felt lied to and the Manager on the phone was yelling, I have never been treated that way it was the most unprofessional and rude experience I have ever had.

DO NOT USE 24/7 LOCKSMITH!!!  They quoted me a price and when they came out told me it was going to cost exactly 10 times what they quoted me. The locksmith then has gone on to repeatedly text me very inappropriate things. I cannot stress enough NOT to use this company!
