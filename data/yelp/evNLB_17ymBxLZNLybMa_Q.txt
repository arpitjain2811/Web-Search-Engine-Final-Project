I saw the one bad review but personally this office has given us some of the BEST service I have had in my 16 years as a State Farm Client. Tina especially has been wonderful and has saved us money on several occasions. David, even as head of the office has personally handled numerous questions. We have our life/home/car insurance all from this office and if an issue ever arises expect them to handle it promptly and professionally.

We have been with State Farm for many years and David Habart has been hands down the best agent we have dealt with. He is responsive, extremely helpful and easy to reach. He has taken the time to review all our policies on a regular basis and found ways to save us money. He really takes an interest in his clients and we have referred him to many of our friends, family and colleagues. Not sure what happened with the other reviewers that were not positive but our experience has always been positive.
