Great hole in the wall place. They take their time and do great work. There are only 2 ladies who work there so anticipate a wait. I will definitely be going back.

This place has great prices! The owner is a sweet humble Asian lady, shes not pushy and she even gave me a free lotion sample on my first visit! What other nail place does that?

When I went here there was only one girl working,she said she is usually alone. Color options were not as large as other places, but honestly, who wants to decide between 15 shades of red. The work was of good quality, but what I appreciated most was when a walk-in came in she was given an accurate quote of how long it would be before she could be helped. I hate not having an appointment and being told "15 minutes, pick a color" and the wait is closer to an hour. Honesty always wins my loyalty. FYI she does not offer waxing,bummer. But the honesty and her dedication to quality is why I would recommend bebes
