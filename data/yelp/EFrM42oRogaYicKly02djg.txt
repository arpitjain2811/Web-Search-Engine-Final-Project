I used to come here all the time when I worked nearby.  Well I am back and nothing has changed but the menu.  They still gave my favorite gyro platter for lunch special.  I had the gyro sandwich it was very good VERY good.  Went back a few days later for the Gyro Platter and its exactly how i remember it.  Going back next weekend or the one after with the family to see how good it is for bringing Children

Whenever I am in the Phoenix area, I make sure this is one of my first places to eat.  The food is phenomenal and the service is nice and friendly.  They have a nice outdoor patio and plenty of seating inside as well.  Prices are reasonable and they have a variety of menu items.  The decor is a bit lacking but that doesn't make it or break it for me.
