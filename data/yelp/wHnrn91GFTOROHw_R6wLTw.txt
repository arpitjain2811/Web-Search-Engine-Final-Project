I won't speak for the whole company, but I will tell this branch is undertrained very unfriendly and makes no apologies for it.

This branch is located inside of the Albertson's. There is an ATM and a small counter with about 3 tellers for your convenience. I have always found the wait time to be under 5 minutes each time I have used a teller. They are friendly and ask if you need other assistance. They do ask that you take off hats and sunglasses while using the facility which is totally understandable because of safety concerns.

There is sometimes a wait and no matter how often I come in they never recognize me.

I have an e-checking account, joined after my husband opened the account. Cost $5.00 for face to face with credit union staff or by a real live person on the phone; pathetic.
