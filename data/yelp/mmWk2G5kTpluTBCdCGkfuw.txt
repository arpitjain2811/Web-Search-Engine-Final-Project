Great texture, fresh ingredients.  We've had a couple pizzas from these guys so far and been happy each time.  The pizza tastes much better than the usual chains and the staff were willing to custom make what the kids wanted.

I completely agree w/ John D. I am from Out of town, but I have eaten my fair share of pizza in the west valley over the past 5 yrs & this place "Sucks"! Horrible food, horrible service. They messed up my ordered & did nothing to fix the problem. Sauce & toppings were not good. Avoid this place at all cost....
