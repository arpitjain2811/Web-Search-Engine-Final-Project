This is one of the few Walgreens with liquor... and a large liquor area.  Not the best selection, but definitely good when you're in a bad mood and just want a fricken drink. Yeah... I had a lot of those days a while back and the poor kid behind the register actually waves at me when I walk in. lol I like it though.  Very quick to check out, never had a problem, and the clerks are friendly.

Really nice employees. Open until 12:00 so, it's really convenient.

I would give no stars if allowed. Betty at checkout was extremely rude and abrasive. However manager working at the rear of store was helpful and gets the star here.
