I cannot even begin to tell you how great this studio is.  If you are interested in learning proper technique and having fun then this is the place for you.  Arthur Le is an exceptional instructor. Kind, patient, and thoughtful.  The entire staff is also this way and it shows throughout all the students. The studio is friendly and respectful and encourages all students to do their best. The studio operates under "Karate for Kids" but it is a Tae Kwan Do studio. I highly recommend this studio for both kids, families, and adults.  My husband and I have been taking classes since October 2008 and we are addicted.  It is a great workout and helps with focus.

I have two children that have been enrolled here since February 2011, and it's fantastic.  One of my children has autism.  The instructors and staff have been so kind and patient with her.   They provide tons of positive reinforcement which, in turn, encourages my children to want to improve and try to be better.  Their attitude at school and at home have also improved...BONUS!!!!
