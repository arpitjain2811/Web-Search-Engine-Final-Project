We were quoted a price over the phone of around $65 to install a dead bolt door lock.  When the locksmith arrived, it was much more.  Around $200.  The locksmith installed the wrong lock, and then insulted me by saying that it was my fault.  I somehow didn't communicate it clearly enough the kind of lock that I wanted installed.  When I called the main office about this, they were insulting as well.  The customer service I received with this company was poor at best.  They price gouge, and their locksmith was very unprofessional.

THIS IS A BAIT N SWITCH SCAM,!! Con men! Do not call Peoria Locksmith mobile Service, or any other service on website locksmithpeoriaaz.com. Or phone# 623-207-9226. They quoted $50 on the phone, then "imprisoned" me by blocking my car until I paid $179! Note that there is no business address on their website, so they can "disappear" if you call to complain. I've filed a police report and complaint with BEtter Business Bureau.
