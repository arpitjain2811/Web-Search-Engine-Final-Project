Rick was as nice a person as you could hope for. Nothing corporate or impersonal about this local car rental agency. Great cars, warm customer service.

My wife had a great idea of renting a convertible for our first trip away from the kids, and we found this business on google.  Ended up getting a Porsche for the week.  Rick (the owner) was super accomidating, picking us up at our hotel, and driving us to the airport after we turned the car in.  Thanks Rick!  We'll be back!

Rick is awesome! Rented a 2014 Corvette Stingray for my wedding and it was a blast. I still dream of driving that thing on the 101.  Thank you!

Very well run business.  Rick was incredibly easy to work with, and offered us a great rental at a great price.  Highly recommend.
