I am not a fan of chain fast food but, I can at least stomach Jack in the Box. I actually really like the teriyaki rice bowl a lot and the egg is fairly decent too. It is not as good as Teriyaki Madness but if you are driving home and it is late and you want something not horrible to eat at midnight then this is the place. Plus for some reason the service here is creepily very good and pretty friendly...Thats strange but I will take it!

This was a great quick stop on the way to the speedway. The food was hot and fresh. The place was very clean and the staff was polite.
