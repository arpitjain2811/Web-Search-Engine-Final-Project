Great Service for a place packed to the rafters with customers. The chili is worthwhile to try.  Nice and spicy, a welcome surprise. Fried pickles are very good.

The steaks are great. The bread is definitely worth breaking your diet for.  The staff was amazing.  Very attentive and treated us like royalty.  We went here for my son's 7th birthday and the girls were so nice to him. He had a great time.  Thank you ladies.

Food was good, and very affordable!  Birthday singing was obnoxiously loud! Not great if you've got babies and old fogies in yer party, pardner! But, them sweet taters, n sweet tea was tasteeeee!  Mmmm, mmmm. I'm only knocking it down on the rating due to the noise being insane!!! However,  we had one in our party who was a lil picky about her prime rib, and the manager was courteous and prompt about offering a new cut, and fresh sides! Great customer service on the manager's part! Just be forewarned,  if you're looking for a quiet dinner spot around 8pm on a Friday night, best keep yer boots in the dust and keep steppin!
