Stopped by this gallery during the March 2010 First Friday to see some work of some people I know (artists, architects, furniture designers, graphic designers, etc...)  Nice and simple little gallery/exhibition space in the Arts District - worth a visit, particularly during the First Friday art crawl.

When Todd has an art show you know it will be totally off the wall, unique and interesting. It is always a mystery.

I stopped in to see Matthew Couper's Skins & Teeth exhibition and thoroughly enjoyed the work, and the space. I was very surprised to see some extraordinary glasswork by Judith Schaechter in the gallery as well. What began as a quick stop become some of my most memorable and pleasant moments in Las Vegas!
