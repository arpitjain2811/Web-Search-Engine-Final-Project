Was in the market for a new toy. Rikki the sales chap was crisp and concise and wanted my business...unlike another ATV dealer down the road. 10 minutes late I was out of there, my new toy arrived 2 hours later at my house...now thats what I call service

I haven't purchased yet but am impressed my the service so far. Seems like a fair place to deal with. I had an absolutely insulting experience at ridenow.

Bought a used KLR from these guys. The sales guy, Rikki, was on point. You would never know that I wasn't buying a big ticket bike, I felt the same level of service as if I had. I've returned since I bought the bike in October to purchase service items and parts and have experienced the same level of service from the counter people. I have recommended them to friends and family and would not hesitate to recommend them to any stranger that asked.
