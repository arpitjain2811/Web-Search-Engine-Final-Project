Usually been given good customer service but was trying to return a few items with receipt and employees had made a mistake with the receipt but clerk told me "our employee couldn't have made this mistake."  I still had the tags and when I brought them in the next day was apparent the employees had mislabeled the clothing items.  The cashier was rude and implied I was lying.  The store manager was also rude and never even apologized!

Love this store. They could care less that my daughter runs around like a maniac in it.

Always a fun place to find interesting toys. They have the usual (Legos, Playmobile, etc) but many of the unusual. A real treat.
