Great Taco Bell. They always ask a couple of times if you want sauce, and I've never NEVER had my order messed up here. That can't be said for a lot of other fast food places nowadays. :)

Dining Room closed at 10PM on a Friday ? Are you kidding me ?  My four year old son and I ended up having to eat our meal in my truck because the dining room was closed. Anyways, the food is always fresh.  Reasonably priced.  Employees are competent and happy.  I have had no bad experience here.

Tuesday at 5 pm . 1) No a.c. in building 2 fans set up for ventilation 2) Not good food and sorta luke warm  3) Bathrooms smell like raw sewage !!!  It is very sad that a company makes 500 million a year and the CEO of the company makes 40 million a year but there resteraunts that have hard working employees at minimum wage must suffer ... so sad that this can be legal  ( I work for Fire safety and am in fast food and resteraunts almost all day long and no this is not just one occurrence , stuff never gets fixed )  SO SAD
