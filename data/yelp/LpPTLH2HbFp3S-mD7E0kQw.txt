Don and his team refinished an antique pool table for us and did an absolutely beautiful job!  They are very professional and do amazing work!

Don't know....they may do excellent work. I wouldn't know! When I emailed them to get an estimate for a small job, they didn't even have the courtesy to respond. Apparently, they don't want to bother with small items.

Excellent service and workmanship! They came to our home and picked up a dresser and crib that had much damage done from a teething child.  Within a week our furniture was returned and looked brand new.  The price was right as well!
