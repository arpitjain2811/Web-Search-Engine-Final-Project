Barry comes out once a month to do our yard cleanup. Mow the lawn, trim the bushes, pull/spray the weeds, the usual. About a week before his first visit, we lost a tree to a storm in the front yard. We had already scheduled him to come out for the first visit while we were going to out of town and we totally forgot to mention the tree to him. When we got back home, to our surprise he had cut up and taken the fallen tree with them while they were at the house. When my wife talked yo him he said yeah we figured we would just grab it while we were already there. AWESOME! Saved me an extra call and a few bucks at the same time and that works for me.

I called them up. They quoted me a fair price. They did the work. No problem.

We have been using this company for three years.  Workers are professional and take care of all our needs.  Extremely happy.  Referred them to our neighbors for a tree removal and they were thrilled with the service and price. Barry has a great system in place.  It works for us and keeps the HOA happy.
