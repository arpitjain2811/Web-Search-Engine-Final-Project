I enjoyed this neat little hole in the wall/ restaurant/dance club/kareoke bar. My only complaint was that the dance floor was SUPER SMALL, so It's makes it hard to get your Cumbia on. I like that the restaurant is open late and you can order food while you drink and dance the night away. The music is great, a mix of latin but mainly Cumbia. The crowd is mix of both young, old, and just plain creepy :b. The staff seems friendly and they were quick on the service.

CAUTION food here is old and rancid, costumer service there is none. P.S. they just changed their name to fool people.
