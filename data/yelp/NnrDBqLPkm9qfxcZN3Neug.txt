The guy that runs this place is really honest!! I bought a phone from him Friday, on Tuesday I went to make a phone call and the speaker was very low. I brought it to him and within an hour he fixed it free of charge. As far as I could tell he had some good phones at reasonable prices to fit any budget!! I am praying my phone lasts awhile. But I will be a returning customer when I need my next phone. Hopefully I won't have to return anytime soon, at least a year, I'm hoping!!  He seems to be busy with customers gladly waiting whenever I am there. I was there about two years ago trying to get a phone flashed and he told me it was too new. As I said he is honest even if he doesn't get your business. He stated he had been in business 10yrs and I can tell why. So far no complaints from me!!
