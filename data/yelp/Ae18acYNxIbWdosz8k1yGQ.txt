A vintage wonderland, and a really cool vibe. The store is clean, and well put together. The staff is super helpful.

I've been shopping with the Attic since the early 1990's. Way before their claim to fame Visa commercial hit the airwaves... New location, I was excited to visit... Positives: 1. Didn't have to pay for entering the store (they used to do this at their prior location). 2. They really do have the best selection of vintage clothing in Vegas. Negatives: 1. Pricey. I'd rather take my chances online and pay half the price. 2. Not the best area of downtown.  I will return. I think?
