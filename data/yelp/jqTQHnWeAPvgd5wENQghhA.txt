I never thought I'd see the day when Walgreens became classier than CVS. This place used to develop photos, now it doesn't. It's just like every other stupid, gross, overpriced and useless CVS in the Valley. Employees are rude or just plain stupid and it's in a terrible area of town, so I won't be going here or any other CVS for that matter.
