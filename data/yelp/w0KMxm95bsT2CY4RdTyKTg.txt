Farrell's is fun and challenging. I'm doing my second round of training now.  I love how they've setup accountability to keep you on track and motivated.

I understand that FXB is under new management. I'm not sure how the place is run now, so I'll post a neutral rating to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, I also agree with the filtered review. The first part of the ten week challenge, everyone was great. They put a lot of emphasis on nutrition (duh, haha) and have speakers come in to talk about eating healthy, answer questions, help with meal plans, etc. The instructors also made a point of repeating this in class and tying it in to the workouts, which I really liked. However, hearing some of the instructors making fun of other students and the way some of the coaches and students conducted themselves turned me off to the place. The program is fantastic and it was a lot of fun, but some of the staff need a training session on how to be less unpleasant.

I love FXB. I finished my 10 week challenge few weeks back and I am still continuing further in their FIT program.  FXB is truly different than most other gyms I've been to. Everyone here is committed to your success and provides the right motivation.  Nutrition is a key to success of this program too. I am trying my best to master it everyday with little changes in my diet.  Last but not the least, the staff is amazing.  They are friendly, helpful and very motivating.  Most of the coaches in my location at one point or another have started this program from the bottom. Nobody here judges you and they are truly there to help you succeed in your fitness goals. This program really, really works.  You'll be amazed with your results.
