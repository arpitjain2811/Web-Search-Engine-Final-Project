The best teriyaki chicken with brown rice, addicting. The sound system there sounds better than most too with 2 big HD tvs.

Food was enjoyable and there was plenty. I just hate when restaurants cheapen the quality of the meat. The steak used to be actual steak but is now a cheap philly steak type of thing and charging for the sauce that used to be put on the food is a bit much as well.

Service at this location during lunch hour is really slow....not good for the working individual that has only an hour for lunch!  But food is still good
