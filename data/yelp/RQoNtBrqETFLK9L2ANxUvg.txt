This dollar store is a cute lil gem tucked in the back of the Fry's Shopping center.  I just moved into this neighborhood last week so I stopped in on part of my 'get to know the area' walking tour.  Lemme just tell you... this place has great deals!  And ex... Rubbermade tupperware that would cost $$ at any other store is only $1 here.  Picture frames that run you $5 and up at other stores are only $1 here.  I also got a silicon rubber spatula for only $1.   This store isn't good for all of your needs but it's fun to browse for cheap holiday decorations, party supplies, kitchen gadgets, and more.  See ya there!

I'm quite impress with the fun items they have there. If you need quick pick up items that are less expensive I would really think of this place to stop first. They have just about everything except food.

I like the black lady that works here! She always make me laugh and she is always in a good mood!
