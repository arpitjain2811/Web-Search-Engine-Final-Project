Quick, friendly, easy. Gotta love easy shipping.  All the supplies are fully stocked and easily accessible.  Clerks are super friendly and helpful as well.  They made shipping my surplus of purchases back home to Jersey super easy.

Well, it's a FedEx store, so as you can imagine, it's pretty quiet. That being said, I've never seen less than 3 staff members on hand to help out if there are any issues. I've been in and out of this joint in under 3 minutes at least a dozen times. You can scoop up anything you need to send out a package and various office supplies if you break your scissors during a mid-day scissor fight.

I dont have a printer at home so I use this store to print, make copies etc. & the staff is always helpful in assisting wt problems I have as I am not very proficient as I should be in printing files. My only complaint is they are not open on weekends BUT I understand completely as Downtown is a "Ghost Town" on weekends as far as the business sector is concerned.

CJ, the manager, is awesome. He helped me figure out just what I needed. I had NO idea FedEx could do all the signs I needed, including window clings, posters, a vinyl banner and foamboard signs that can be contour cut!
