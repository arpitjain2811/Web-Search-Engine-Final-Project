I've been taking kenpo from Z Ultimate for about a month, and am almost ready to progress to yellow belt, thanks to the great instruction from all the guys here.  They offer beginner, advanced, and mixed group classes for adults, and your monthly fee includes a private lesson each week (30 minutes).  I had taken kenpo before more than a decade ago, and was excited to start up again.  In one group lesson I had learned more than I had done at my previous studio in a whole month.  The group classes will definitely give you a good work out!  I've had my private lessons with Jacob, who is a great teacher.

These guys are great.  Started a few years ago doing Thai chi and now doing weapons and martial arts.  Casey is mellow, fun and really knows his stuff.  Hate doing reviews, love Casey.  Go Z Ultimate.
