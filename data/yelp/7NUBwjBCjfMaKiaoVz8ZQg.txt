The receptionist is such a sweetheart and the Doctor really does care about your well being, so much so that he gives his patients his and the receptionists personal cell phone numbers in case you need him immediately. I highly recommend coming here and am glad I found this place.

Friendly, helpful receptionist, and the doctor is very communicative.  He takes good care of you and suggests things you can do at home to help with any problems.

My family has used him since we first moved here in 1998 from New York.  He is very caring and will go out of his way to help you. He will see you at a drop of a hat! Literally, My husband dropped his hat and when he bent over his back went out!! Doc  to the rescue.  The whole office is awesome. You don't find to many like him in Las Vegas. Highly recommend him.
