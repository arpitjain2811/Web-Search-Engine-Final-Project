The Gillis Centre in Marchmont is a combination of things; a church, a Catholic retreat centre and a bed and breakfast.  I've only really encountered it in the latter capacity, as when I lived down the road it become the accommodation of choice for visiting parents, mainly due to its convenient location. It's also a very peaceful place, with tranquil grounds set just off the main road, and, I suppose, a generally spiritual atmosphere.  You certainly don't have to be Catholic to stay here, as long as you don't object to being surrounded by Catholic iconography; the corridor, as you go to breakfast, for example, has a very informative display of popes along the walls, while various saintly figures beam down at you wherever you are. The rooms are simple and comfortable, the prices reasonable and the staff very hospitable.  So unless you're fervently anti-religious, the Gillis is a restful place to stay, and not far from the city centre.
