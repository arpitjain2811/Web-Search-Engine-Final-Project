Dr. Chris and Sonya are the best!  I was amazed with the level care I received. When I was done they had gone over every detail to ensure I fully understood where I was at and what to do to prevent it from re-occurring. They made me feel like a pro as they gave me all the info I needed so I can say goodbye to my back problems for good. They even did my 3D back scan right in the office.  One word sums it up.  Amazing!

Dr. Chris is a great chiropractor. He has adjusted me several times and I always feel like he addresses all of my concerns. I've been adjusted by many different chiopractors and Dr. Chris is one of the best. Thanks Dr. Chris!

This chiropractor cracks me up. Don't worry about scheduling an appointment because they are super flexible and they'll make all the adjustments necessary. Don't be spineless, get up the nerve and come in. They may have a bone to pick with you, but everything will straighten out in the end. Don't get bent out of shape if you have to go back more than once though.
