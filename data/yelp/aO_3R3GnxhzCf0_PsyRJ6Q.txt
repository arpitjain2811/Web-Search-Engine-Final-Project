QT know how to do gas stations right. They are always clean, Staffed, well mannered, good knowledgeable people. I always try to go here if I can.  They also have some pretty awesome sandwiches and taquitos that always pretty fresh and hot. I like there breakfast sandwiches too. AND of course the 69 cent fountain drinks.

Always clean, always fully stocked, never creepy people soliciting, quik trip! They also have competitive prices! Friendly customer service, too. But the title of this location is spelled wrong.

Quick Trip has always been my fav in the valley. Usually clean and great on service. EXCEPT THIS ONE'S BATHROOMS!  WOW. Towels on the floor and toilets that were not clean. I believe the staff need to clean the bathrooms more frequently.
