Cute little store with cute designs. Perfect for the downtown container park project. I don't wear watches. Otherwise, I'd consider one of her snap watches. Instead, I picked up his and hers scarves. The hers is for me.

Awesome watches, great designs, and a fun atmosphere.  The owner Winky and her husband are 2 of the nicest people we've met and it was cool to meet the person behind the watches.  I highly reccomend stopping in and checking out the selection of cool designs and saying hello to Winky!
