Mary is amazing ! I've been coming to her for 3 years and I'll never go anywhere else. She very gentle and has my business for life !

I randomly found this place because I was nearby. I will be back! Mary is super knowledgable and helpful. Much cheaper than Face Logic, etc, for an equally great time. Very happy to be back soon.

I love going to see Mary. She's very good at what she does and caters facials etc to your needs and skin type. Also, always on time and very clean business. I've been getting my waxing and all skin care needs from Mary for years and will never trust or go to anyone else.
