The store is clean and the staff is always friendly. I went in for Science Diet dog food and paid $6 less than what Petco wanted.

I went into this location for the first time yesterday. I usually shop at a different location but I am tired of them not having what I want. I was pleasantly surprised this location had 2 or 3 bags of the food I needed. The customer service was good. Looks like I have a new Pet Club

Went in here for a product they didn't end up having (wasn't expecting them to have it) and ended up seeing that they have the food I get for my cats, which is hard to find since it's healthy and not Iams crap full of corn. To be honest I was surprised at their selection of good stuff because I thought they would be more like a Petco.  This is an awesome find since they are much closer than going to where I usually go.  Yay Pet Club!
