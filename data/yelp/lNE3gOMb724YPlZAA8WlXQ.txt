Really efficient denny's! Great in a pinch.

Great staff, open 24-7, clean, and they have security there at night so when things started to get shaky with certain customers they fix the issue fast

Horrible food. It takes real effort to botch up a turkey sandwich...so because of their obvious diligence in that regard, I'm giving them one star.

It's Denny's.  What can I say.  Typical chain food.  Service is good.  Kids love it.  Comfortable atmosphere.  Prices are low.

For starters, this place has a very strong moldy smell to it. From looking at the old stained carpets, this seems where it may be comming from.  Next, I ordered a soda and my glass was dirty and had oily stains from it.  I've been to other Denny's Resturants, but this by far is the dirtiest establishment I've been to.  I was afraid to try the food, fearing that the Kitchen (shielded from view) would be worse than what customers are able to see.  I would recommend someone inspect the air quality and cleaniness of this establishment.
