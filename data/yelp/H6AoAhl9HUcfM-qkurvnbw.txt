Bar far the best haircut I have ever received. I recently moved from Arizona to Seattle and I have not been able to find a barber that can match Ely. I highly reccomend! He is very precise and takes his time to ensure that he gives the best cut possible.

The owner is from NYC and escaped the hustle and bustle of the big city.  He knows his stuff, excellent barber. Excellent service - went over and beyond what I asked for.  I have been looking for a good barber on this side of town.  Finally found it.

Definitely one of the best barbers on the westside of town. Ely takes his time and makes sure you are satisfied. I have tried a few different barbers around town and this is the best spot by far! I recommend this spot if you're looking for a great and friendly barber!

Every time I've been at this shop Ely hooks it up with a really nice cut!  Also make sure to go when it's not busy since he's the only barber.

I've been around the world and have grown to appreciate real barbers like they have throughout Turkey.  Here Armen is a master. Don't be fooled by the simple decor and older neighborhood. This place is a buried treasure if you want a real cut by someone who enjoys their work.  He came from Uzbekistan then to NYC then to Scottsdale now he owns this place in Glendale. It's worth a trip. Get the works: hair beard mustache.
