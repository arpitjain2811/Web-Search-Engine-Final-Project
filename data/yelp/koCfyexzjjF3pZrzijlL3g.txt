Food....not as bad as I thought it would be.  Pancakes were hot and fluffy, coffee was good. Ambiance....dirty, crowded, and loud. Staff....abysmally slow on a Saturday am. Verdict....if you have to get your all-you-can-eat pancake fix, I guess.

Dirty drink glass, overly salt potatoes in skillet, grease beyond belief on bottom of skillet and the bathroom was more filthy and deplorable than proper etiquette can speak of a

I take my kids on Thursdays and they eat free. The food is always excellent and the service great.
