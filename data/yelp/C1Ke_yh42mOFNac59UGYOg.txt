I have been to this subway a bunch of times, and it seems that they never have fresh veggies.  The lettuce always has some red on it, the tomatoes are slimy, and I'm never sure about the rest of it.  There are other subways in the area, the one on Waddell and Lichtfield being much better.  Whenever I go there, if something doesn't look fresh, they toss it.

I love this subway! It's clean, fast, and I always leave happy. Krystal, who is also the manager, is always sooo friendly! Ex: I told her I was dieting and she gave me all kinds of tips! She removed some of my bread , loaded up on  my fav veggies, no cheese and also gave me light mayo packets so I could measure exact calories. I always appreciate great customer service, I am loyal to this particular subway just because of that!
