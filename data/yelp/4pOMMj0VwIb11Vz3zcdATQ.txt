This new salon in Fountain HIlls is great.  The stylists are professional and the atmosphere is pleasant.  The prices can't be beat.  $14 for a haircut with shampoo.  Great value, great place.  Give it a try.  I will be back.

The salon is easy to find, open, airy, and comfortable.  The owner Deena is outstanding.  She is super skilled and talented yet gets the job done quickly; no muss, no fuss...like pressing the "easy button."  Kelly styled my hair as well and she is also outstanding.  What I especially like about this salon is that walk-ins are welcome.

Deena was wonderful! I was traveling through AZ and stopped in for a haircut. She listened to me, gave me exactly what I wanted in a haircut! Wish I was closer so I could make it my regular salon! Don't let the incredibly reasonable $ for a haircut fool you, she is super skilled!!

I was visiting from Cape Cod MA and didn't have a chance to get a haircut before I left. I was worried about trying someplace new. I got the best haircut from Deena and didn't even have an appt.  When I got home friends even commented how much younger I looked! Music to my ears! She truly is a gift and I highly recommend Simply Marvelous. Besides the price is right at $14.
