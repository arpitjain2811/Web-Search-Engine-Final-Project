"6 inch tuna on white bread, with everything including spinach, but NO pickles". Not even joking, this THE only subway that ever gets my sandwich right. Thank you for the $5 meal deal, it beats the other chains in this shopping plaza as far as price for lunch.

They make your sandwich the way you ask for it.  Plus, they're fast and gave me a free cookie card for being in the health profession. Three stars because I consider Subway to be an average chain and not gourmet food.
