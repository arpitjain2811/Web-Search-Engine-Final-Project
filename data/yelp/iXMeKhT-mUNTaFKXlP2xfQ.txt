Had a backed up drain last night (from cooking).  Got on Craigslist at 9am, found Darrel, and he was at my house by 11am.  Super friendly, fast service, and $45 flat fee drain cleaning.  Good and honest service!

Drains in kitchen and bathroom were slowly moving and kitchen drain was clogged. Called at 9:00am and he was here by 1:00pm. Drains are clean and moving good. Darrel was very nice and informative. I would highly recommend him to anyone.
