This place is old school. It's like walking into a time warp when you enter this store. They're pretty clean and organized, but this place is seriously in need of some updating. The two times I've had to wait for my fella to get some paperwork done at the DMV, I wander across the street to kill some time.  The store is small, but they do have a lot of stock and they have a good selection of NFL sport items for pretty reasonable prices. Good for gifts this time of year, so I've picked up the random odd and end here on the two times I've wandered in. Service is ok, nothing spectacular. All in all, pleasant shopping experience.
