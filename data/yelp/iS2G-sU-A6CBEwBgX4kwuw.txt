This is a really nice park. I have been coming here for the past few years to walk as one entire loop around on the sidewalk is a mile. The police department is also there so it makes you feel extra safe. I know that there are many  kid activities such as football practice, soccer practice, you name it, happens here especially during the spring, fall and winter months when the weather is nice. Many people have picnics here as well as bring their pets out for a nice leisurely walk. If you are in the area, check this place out. Go for a walk or have a picnic.

This is a good park!  It is a public park so you can expect to find the occasional used bandaid and cigarette butt in the sand- but so long as you keep an eye on your little one (mine is only one) then you should be fine.  I love that they have two separate playgrounds - one for older kids and one for younger!
