Nice, clean place. Rooms had ample space...missing a pool though!

We used to stay here as a jeep club some years ago and really like it. Times have changed. An investment group has taken over and the friendly atmosphere is missing. Wifi is non existant unless you are in the office. Signs of aging. Staff is not very friendly.

Decent price, 80 bucks a night and very clean. Checked the beds right away when we checked in. The manager on duty did not greet me when we came in so I said hello and she turns around and calls the other staff member to help check us in. Thought it was rude, but the young guy helped us and he was friendly. I notice the manager packing her stuff up to leave for the day so that's why she didn't want to help. Besides that, clean rooms what matters to me. Old style tv though, but will be out visiting family not watching tv.
