Excellent tennis club, attached to a community Tree Top Park. The Tennis club is in the same parking lot of the kids play area

Very nice park with lots of fun stuff for the little ones, as well as a lot of seating for adults to watch the kiddos.

This is a typical Summerlin park. Clean, well maintained, etc.  What I like about it is you can walk down a trail between housing developments and under a street and come put in Tree Top park!
