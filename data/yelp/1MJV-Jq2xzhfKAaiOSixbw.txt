Not recommended. I went to go see "doctor" Kelley to try acupuncture for the first time. I tried to stay open minded, but it became very clear that she both didnt care about my concerns or seem to know much about what she was doing. When asked how this works, she responded, "I dont know, it just does!". She was nice enough, but had terrible "bed side manner". Very pushy when it comes to things like buying herbs after my session - I was never even asked, just handed me a bottle (which she immediately opened) and charged me for it. I said no and that I wanted a refund for them - she rolled her eyes and scoffed because, "Now I cant sell them." Well you opened them!! Never did she once apologize about how disappointed I was in her service nor did she offer a refund of any kind.  See someone else.

I started going to Dr. Fiona Kelly over six months ago after a serious bout of ill health and a bad experience with a "Western" pulmonary doctor who just wanted to keep me on steroids and other medications that had side affects that I felt were worse than the possible, "eventual" health benefits.   After working with Dr. Kelly on breathing techniques and learning which foods will help increase my overall health, I do not have a direct need for an inhaler or other medication(s). I will note that if my health does start to turn sideways, she makes adjustments to my treatment to offset the illness and if needed will suggest that I see my general practitioner. She can be a bit quirky, but who can't be. Overall I'd say she has her patients best interest at heart.
