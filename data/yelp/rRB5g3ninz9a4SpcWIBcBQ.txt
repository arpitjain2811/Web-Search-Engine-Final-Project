I like this store.  I don't want to say they have everything, but they sure have a lot of stuff.   Oddly the thing I like the most is their selection of nuts/bolts/screws/etc.  If you ever need that odd nut/bolt/screw/etc to fix something around the house this is the first place you should check.  Unlike other hardware stores they have hundreds of selection.  A few weeks back I needed two odd sized nut/bolt combinations to fix my lawn mower.  They had what I needed and I was in an out in about 5 minutes. Good stuff.
