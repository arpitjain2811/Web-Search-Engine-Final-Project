Great breakfast burrito. Very friendly and not shy on the serving size!!  The tortilla is soft and flavorful and the bacon is nice and thick. I couldn't even eat half of it so I'm looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.  I just wish they gave you more salsa!

We ordered two combos... tthe refried beans were a bit watery-other than that it was pretty average. The rice was pretty good. The meals were under $15.00 for two people.

The Best Street Side Tacos in Phoenix! I've been searching for real tacos in Phoenix for years and this place has them. Cabeza, lengua, carne, pastor and there served up with grilled jalepenos and onions. Everything is great their tortas, beans, rice, ceviche. The flavors are spot on.
