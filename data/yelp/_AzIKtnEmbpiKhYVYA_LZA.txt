Conveniently located off the 95 freeway, and close to the Meadows Mall, I used the Drive-Thru window (saturday hours too) a lot and it was busy! On numerous occasions, Jerry helped me (we were in training together- yes, I worked for the credit union, for a brief time.) and was very nice (I don't know if he recognized me the last few times though but maybe it was a  busy time). The two times that I went into the branch: it was clean, and there were only a few other members, so I didn't wait too long to get to the window. I was treated courteously. The members seemed to be the more mature set, which was good, because I used to see some strange members at the other branches (if you used to work with me, you know what I am talking about!). There was a coin machine but I think that they did away with that.

Great place to get an auto loan. I don't have the best credit, but got 2.7%. Everywhere else was over 8%.

Only 3 reviews?!?! Geez!  Been with these guys for over 10 years AND have also had Wells & BOFA-WestStar tops them all! Interest rates are low, great customer service and they don't cut off a limb if you ever have an incident! I had a couple overdrafts back when when I first opened my account and it was a smooth process to resolve. The branches are always clean, you're in and out on all banking errands, no craziness.  CONS: (A) They only have two locations in town :-( (B) Be prepared to pay fee's at every ATM if you ever  need to pull cash.  PROS: Sign up for direct deposit to limit your runs to the bank & if you need to pull cash, go to any convenience store for cash back. :-) Problem solved!
