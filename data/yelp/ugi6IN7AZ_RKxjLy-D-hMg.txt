Seriously had to downsize my living space in my last move and didn't have a place to put everything.  Found this place nearby and was thrilled by the 2 months free deal.  Great customer service.  Chris was a doll!  Clean unit with great security and elevator access right to my unit.  Chris made the move in process so easy.  I definitely would recommend Smart Bargain.  Thanks Chris!

Very nice and accommodating! Highly recommend. Air conditioned storage, lots of different storage room sizes, elevator, secure, inexpensive, and they usually have great deals!   I can't believe the price considering how nice this place is. Plus they use solar energy which is amazing!!

Unbelievably inexpensive.  They are running various specials right now that will blow you away.  I literally felt like I got away with robbery.  This place is fantastic.  Great customer service, air conditioned units, friendly atmosphere, it just can't be beat.
