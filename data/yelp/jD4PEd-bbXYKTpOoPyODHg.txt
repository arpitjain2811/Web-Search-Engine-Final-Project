It's just a small kiosk in the Vons grocery store, but there are plenty of tables and chairs to relax after a bike ride in the Anthem Hills. The people are always friendly at this one and the service is super fast. Parking is plentiful. If you live in Anthem and are making your way toward Eastern this is the perfect SBUX location for you!

I love the convenience of being able to get a Starbucks coffee while I'm shopping! The staff is always very friendly too.

I can't believe they charge for one pump of syrup at this store now. I will definitely not come back to this Starbucks.
