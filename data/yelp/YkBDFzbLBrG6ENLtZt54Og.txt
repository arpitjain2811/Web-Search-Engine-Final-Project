Absolutely the nicest, most beautiful and unique convention area in Las Vegas. The bathrooms are always kept clean, with complimentary individual size mouthwash and lotion by every sink, restocked regularly. The hallway is breathtaking, one wall is entirely glass, overlooking the pool complex, and letting in actual sunlight, so one can still get one's daily dose of Vitamin D even in a full day of meetings! There are modern, sleek looking couches and loveseats that are very comfortable to relax in. The meeting rooms and ballrooms are designed beautifully, with wood paneling and acoustically absorbing wall panels (important to me as a sound engineer working in them!). Even the outdoor smoking area is well kept, with real trees for shade. It's definitely my favorite place to work in town.
