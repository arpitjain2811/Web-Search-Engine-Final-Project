I don't really know what to make of Niche of Queensferry, of "Niche Gallery". Basically this is a gallery/gift shop that displays and sells all manner of art. To try and sum it up I would say it offers sculptures, hand made ceramics,  traditional Scottish gifts and crafts as well as fashion clothing and jewelry. Quite a lot to cover huh? But even within those there is a wide range. Take sculpture. You will find quite cheap, popular little sculptures of cars or cartoonish animals or something, next to abstract contemporary art! They sell African wood carvings, next to goth style Dragon ornaments! Needless to say expect to pay very different amounts depending on the very different items you're buying. I'm not sure what else to say really. I think I kind of like this place. I get the impression the owners have just bought in any piece of art they think anybody will like. I think that's quite honest.
