I used student tutor last year my daughter and had a wonderful tutor named Alyssa. I started back up again this year for my daughter who needs additional help in math, this time we have a tutor named Heather. Heather is phenomenal, she is so helpful and my daughter really understands what she is saying. Heather is extremely flexible with scheduling and is always so willing to help. I have had a wonderful experience with student tutor and I highly recommend them.

Todd is an excellent tutor! My son wanted tutoring for the SAT and we found Todd. He did an excellent job in his review course and Cameron really got a lot if it. The fees are reasonable compared to most SAT review course. My sons' scores went up to 1680 and he started at 1440.
