Not too bad of a place. Beer is always cold. Haven't tried the food. Open late every night (they don't close early like some other places). The entry doors and bathrooms are leftover from when the building was a McDonald's...which I think is cool in a kind of kitschy way. Big place, plenty of room to spread out.

The food was w/e but the staff were unbearable. Never again.

This place is terrible. The burgers are stale and the bread tastes like it's a few days old.

Typical bar food. The cheese curds were delicious--some of the best I've ever had. The rest of the food was decently good.  It's pretty much what you would expect for bar food. They have a shot wheel.  The shots are $3, and you spin the wheel to figure out what shot you will take. There are lots of things to do...pool tables, darts, video blackjack, etc.

The owner is rude and dishonest.
