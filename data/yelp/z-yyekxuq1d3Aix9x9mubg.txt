Kavabean Commons is a great little cafe/restaurant in Downtown Kitchener.  With friendly service and tasty beverages, it's a welcome treat for those times when I an in Downtown Kitchener near the Charles Street Terminal for Grand River Transit.  Fans of the A. L. Van Houtte coffee will be happy to know that it is proudly served here.  Normally I just get my coffee to go... but coffee isn't all there is to Kavabean Commons, there's also great breakfast, snacks and lunch specials for those looking for more than liquid refreshment.

Halfway in between your local greasy spoon and Starbuck, Kavabean offers great breakfasts with an ambiance closer to a higher-end coffee shop. Service is quick, the seating is clean and comfortable, and the windows let in lots of light. Go for tea, coffee, light lunch or breakfast, but avoid if you're looking for something fancy or real sit-down service.
