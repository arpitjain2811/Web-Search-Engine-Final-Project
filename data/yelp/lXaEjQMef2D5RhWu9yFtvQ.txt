I work at a Thai restaurant around the corner, and our restaurant has Bike Force deliver for us. All of their riders are quick and as a restaurant we don't ever have any problems with them. We have quite a few regulars who order delivery and they all comment on the great customer service. These guys are awesome to have in downtown Phoenix.
