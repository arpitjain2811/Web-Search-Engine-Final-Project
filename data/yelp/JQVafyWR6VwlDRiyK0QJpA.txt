Kam Yin is a Chinese restaurant located in the same plaza as the Beechwood Zehrs in Waterloo, it's been around for years and there are those I know who have lived in Kitchener-Waterloo all their life who love the place.  The place serves Chinese-Canadian food and has cheap lunch specials.  I popped by recently on a Friday for lunch and boy was it busy.  The food came out fresh and fast, and the service was good despite the crowd!

Awesome  American-style Chinese food. My partner and I often go out of our way to eat hear when we are in the mood for "Chinese". The portion sizes are huge, food taste great. It's been in business for years and for good reason. Definitely recommend.
