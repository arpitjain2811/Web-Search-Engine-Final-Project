Me and my sons always come here for a quick fade. All the barbers are skilled and awesome. We've never left unhappy with our haircut and during football, they have all the college games on.

After searching for another place that didn't exist, I found Frank's, which looks closed from the outside, but its open. It was Saturday and there were at least six barbers waiting to serve customers. Most chains don't offer this luxury. I popped in and Yolanda took care of my cut in about 20 minutes. No scissors needed, but she was pretty good with the razor. Only $10 for a haircut also and these folks are professional, so its a great deal. think i finally found a decent hair joint.

The best barber shop in South Phoenix...I hardly ever have to wait for a barber and they do it right every time.
