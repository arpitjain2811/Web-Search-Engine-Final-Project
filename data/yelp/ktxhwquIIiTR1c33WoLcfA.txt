The Attorney Michelle is helpful and knowledgeable about probate, wills, trusts and guardianship matters.  I have used their services for all my estate planning needs and also corporate formation!  EXCELLENT SERVICE.  I recommend them highly.

Michelle drew up our trust and living will. I put it off for a long time becuase 1. my own mortality scares me and 2. the amount of thought required to cover all contingencies was more than I wanted to deal with. But Michelle met with my husband and I for an hour, gave us a one- or two-page sheet for "homework" to think about and had us come back two weeks later to finalize the paperwork and sign the docs. DONE! It was so easy and it's such a relief to have it done and over and know that if something happens to me that my three kids are taken care of. Michelle made it painless and easy.
