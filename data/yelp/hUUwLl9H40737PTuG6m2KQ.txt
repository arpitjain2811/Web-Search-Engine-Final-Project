Finally found a great hair salon thats near where I live.  I've been a fan of Aveda salons for over 15 years but since moving from San Diego hadn't found one that worked for me.  Secret's is great - relatively easy to get an appt, they stay on schedule and prices are reasonable for the quality of service.  My stylist is Mandy and every cut and color has been great!  I do wish the salon was open on Mondays because that's my day off from work

Finally, I have found a great stylist at a great salon with a great product line.  We moved to Phoenix almost 2 years ago and I have had a very hard time finding a stylist I want to be loyal to!  Mandy at Secrets is great!!  She gave me a great cut - which was needed badly - and great Aveda hi-lites.  Since Secrets is an Aveda concept salon, all Aveda products are used.  I'm thrilled!!

This is a great salon!  Extra points for being on the West Side of town where there aren't a lot of choices for great salons.  I have been here and have taken my daughter here also.  We both feel they are professional, stylish and offer suggestion which sometimes is much needed.  I will definitely be going back.
