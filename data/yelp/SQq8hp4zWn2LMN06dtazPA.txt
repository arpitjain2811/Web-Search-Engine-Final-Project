Our experience with Tesla was nothing but positive. From scheduling to taking the car out on a test drive, everything was professional and we were treated very well.  The Tesla staff was very courteous and knowledgeable about the products. Our guide on the test drive was incredible and she made the experience a remarkable one. We test drove the Model S and I recommend everyone giving this car a spin. We were not currently in the market for a new car and were just visiting Vegas from out of state, but the Tesla folks did not mind and were not aggressive in trying selling us a car. They were very excited to have us and treated us not different than potential buyers. Also, the car really sells itself! I've still being blown away by how wonderfully designed the Model S was. They literally have thought of everything! So if you're liking for something awesome to do in Las Vegas, drive a Model S at Tesla!

so far so good.... forgot to charge it tho, amidst ridiculous reminders everywhere in the house.   Oh well.   Cab to work today.   Five stars if I can get used to this thing.   And I'm happy with the white.     good recommendation.
