Snagged myself a gyro on a cold and windy Wisconsin afternoon. Holy cow it was so good. The meat was piping hot, and juicy. Absolutely didn't mind the gyro juice dropping of my face as I scrambled through the sidewalks. The veggies were fresh and incredibly satisfying. I loved that it was cheap (about $6). Def try this out next time you're around.

I should give this man another shot. I don't think it's fair for me to give a bad review based on one time visit there. Yeah, I don't really like the chicken shawarma. But some people buying the falafel seemed to enjoy theirs. So I may be back to try other stuff so I can give a more comprehensive review.  So far, the shawarma is a big no no for me.  But, I will be back and hopefully I can give them a 4 star rate.

Great street Cart dining on the state Capitol square in Madison. The falafel was huge!  Really should have split it between the two of us. The kids enjoyed their burgers. My hubby really wanted a gyro but sadly they were out.
