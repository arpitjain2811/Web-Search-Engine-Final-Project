One of the worst customer service experiences I've had.  No one has the power to do anything but collect your money.  When you try to talk to their corporate offices, be prepared to sit on hold for a good 10 to 15 minutes navigating their phone menu, before you get to talk to a person who will tell you they can't do anything. They have units you can put your stuff in.  That's about all you can expect from this company.  Anything more than that is setting yourself up for disappointment.

I'm not one to write reviews and in fact this is my first one because I have to say that Deborah's customer service is absolutely awesome! She follows up with you and truly has a passion for helping her customers. I know it's just a storage unit but in my book, anytime someone goes above and beyond others should know about it!  I recommend this place. Thanks Deborah.

We came in to get a storage unit the two ladies that helped us were extremely helpful.  And friendly. We are happy overall right now.
