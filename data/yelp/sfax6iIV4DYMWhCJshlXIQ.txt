I've been getting coffee here since they opened years ago. Same employees all of these years, even though its in Safeway- that's pretty cool. Coffee is standard, prices are high. $10 for 2 grande mochas. Only Starbucks... :/

Convenient location. It's right across the street from where I work, so when I'm in need of caffeine I come here. Staff has always been pleasant.
