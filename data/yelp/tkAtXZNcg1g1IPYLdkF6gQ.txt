I have had Chad and his company servicing my pool for the last 12 years. I don't usually post reviews but feel everyone should know that he is a honest, knowledgeable pool guy and really takes the time to listen to any customer. He provides the best service I have every had from a pool company.

Keep'n it Blue has been servicing my pool for almost 8 years.  Chad and Co always take the time to not only listen and address my concerns, but also patiently explain what's going on with my pool, in a language I understand.  I am 100% satisfied with the service I receive from Keep'n it Blue.
