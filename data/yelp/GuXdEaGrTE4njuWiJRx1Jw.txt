Dr. Tom is wonderful, at least the couple times I have been able to see her.  They have so many patients that you can never get a appointment with your doctor, they are booked at least 3 months out. It's about volume here.

I can't speak for the rest of the doctors, but I have been seeing Dr. Tom for 20+ years now.  She takes the time each and every visit to sit down and chat with me, even about personal issues in my life.  I 'm sure she's even run late because I've taken too much of her time, but she's never made me feel that she's "rushed".  She's very professional, personable, and knowledgeable.  I like that she takes time to answer my questions. She is thorough and makes sure I don't have any questions before I leave.  I've never had any problems at DWOG, not with the care, insurance, billing, or general office staff.  ALL gyn offices are busy and I think its standard to have to book out 3-months before your annual pap/pelvic exam.  Knowing that, getting in with your doctor should not be a problem.
