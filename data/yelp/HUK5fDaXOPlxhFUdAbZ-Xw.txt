Discovered this place before Christmas when it was under different ownership and loved it, was just as impressed when we returned. The service was great, the food was amazing and the staff were so friendly. Go there anytime I'm in Edinburgh now.

Nice, clean restaurant with a really friendly environment! The staff are really friendly and the chefs quirky! They always cook my steak to perfection!

Disappointed to find the reality of Bar Frizzante far short of the ratings!  Food nothing beyond average.  Their basic red sauce was overly sweet and heavy on the oregano and my wife's seafood risotto was nothing more than a variety of seafood on a bed of rice - nothing of the texture and complexity that elevates a true risotto to a sublime level.  All ingredients used were of decent quality but the cooking took them nowhere.  The room was very bright and rather loud and despite numerous other Edinburgh meals that were on the leisurely side (which we came to assume to be the local custom) we were in and out of this place in no time which completely threw off the timing of the rest of the evening.  I can easily think of ten South Philadelphia red sauce Italian restaurants that would put this place out of business in three months.  Cheers.  John J.
