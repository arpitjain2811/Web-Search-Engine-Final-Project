The only thing I tried was the hot chocolate, which was good, nothing breathtaking .... the same as 7-11 to me. However the smell inside was AMAZING. The chocolate looks sooooo good, but VERY expensive. 2 chocolate covered preztels $5.75.....

Chocolate heaven! That should be enough but the aroma when the door opens is a alluring temptresses you just cant say no to. I hit this store twice in 24 hours. Didnt feel guilty as I walked off almost all the calories I consumed over the weekend.

Every time I come here I always get friendly service and delectable treats! The candy apples and fudge are to die for. Highly recommend while you are in Lake Las Vegas.
