3.5 Stars This self serve car wash is not different than any others.  They keep the lot clean and the machines always work.  You can't ask for anything else right!  How about a automatic car wash with a dry, they have that too.  I have not had much interactions with the staff so when nothing comes to mind then it wasn't bad.

Best deal in the whole valley. $11 and I get a super car wash with pre-scrubbing and towel drying and tire treatment. The guys are very professional and nice. I've spent four times this price for a "detailed" wash that wasn't half as good. Plus, they're environmentally friendly. Love this place!!
