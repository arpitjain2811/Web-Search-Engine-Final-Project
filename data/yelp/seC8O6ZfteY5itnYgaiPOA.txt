Anyone who's been in Vegas for awhile knows that the coffee shops that aren't the GlobalMegaCorp Starbucks (but have a Seattle coffeehouse feel) are few and far between.  I live in Seattle, and can vouch for the fact that every time I come here, I feel like I've been transported back into Seattle, if only for a short amount of time.  Excellent coffee, friendly baristas, and huge comfy sofas.

This place closed years ago, why is it even on the list?

This place used to be such a blast.  One of the final great coffee houses in vegas!
