Looking for a CU Shared Branch location? This is one I recommend. It's got good parking and an easy to access ATM if you want to get off I-215 in a hurry, pull your cash and then get back on I-215. If you go inside you will find friendly and helpful staff. Some locations seem to look down on shared branch members, but not here. You can get service with a smile, and without any attitude. There's hardly any lines either at least when I've been there.  Their ATM also accepts shared branch deposits....which can be hard to find. Overall, 4 stars.

Maybe it was just a bad day, but it was absolutely horrible...  The lady who was helping me to open an account was not friendly at all.  No smile or anything!  She acted like if she wanted to go home, so I left and went to Bank of America.  They made my day!!!

Friendly and efficient, what not to like? parking was good, i would give it a 5 star if exiting the parking lot was not confusing, hahaha
