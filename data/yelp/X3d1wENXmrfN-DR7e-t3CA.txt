Wassup Henderson Locale!  When it comes to worshipping GOD, this chapel has a cozy feel to it. Yes it is a small building but you cannot tell from the people that perform and attend here!  There is nothing that feels better than being uplifted and rejuvenated by the words of GOD. Of course you don't have to take my words for it. Go attend a bible study or worship service and find out for your self.  Call for a schedule of the times for these events. Search for the truth.
