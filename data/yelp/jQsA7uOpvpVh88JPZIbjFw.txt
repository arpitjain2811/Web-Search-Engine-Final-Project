I'm a Goodwill refugee since they raised their prices.  Epic Thrift has good stuff but their prices are about the same as Goodwill's.  I found some nice things there that I purchased but if you know what you're doing, you can buy brand new clothes for almost the same price.

It's a new thrift store, that occupies what used to be Safeway. I've stopped in a couple of times and didn't find what I was looking for - but I was looking for very specific things both times. I haven't gone in to browse around yet.  There's lots of clothes, some knick-knacks, books...the electronics section is pretty sparse, but like I said - it's new.

I just love this place! Every time I come in the staff is really nice. There's tons of stuff to rummage through. They give out 50% off coupons. They have colored tag sales and also $1.00 days.  It's a fun place to shop and you can get killer bargains if you are savvy about these savings offers. I probably shouldn't even say this but I am a part time online reseller and I have found great items to list in my Etsy shop. The best part is that this place benefits the families of our troops. It's win win win!
