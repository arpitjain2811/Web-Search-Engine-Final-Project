I love Julianne. My kids are learning so much. I like the fact she lets me know what they need to work on for the next time rather than taking my money and leaving. Lol. Plus you can't go wrong with her coming to your house teaching your child to play.

Julianne has been teaching piano to our twelve-year-old daughter for six years now.  Our daughter loves her lessons, looking forward to them each week.  Julianne is professional, engaging, and wonderfully friendly.  We would highly recommend her.
