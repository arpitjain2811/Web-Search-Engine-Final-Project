I had just moved here from Maryland 3 months before going to Marcedes. The Dominican Salon i went to twice before kept trying to make me get a relaxer and eventually i ended up cutting it :(. It was so hard to find a stylist who could tend to my natural hair care needs. My hair looked a hot mess and I had just been offered a job. I googled Black Stylists and my search began. I called Marcedes the night before I was to start my new job. I explained the story and she took pity on me lol. She booked an appointment for me  that upcoming Friday....I have been with her ever since. That was 2 years ago! My hair has grown and will soon be the length it was before cutting it. A good talented stylist is so hard to find and trust me I'm not letting this one go!

I've been going to Marcedes for more than a year. My hair was thinning and shedding, she had worked a miracle. My hair is now very healthy and shiny. Marcedes is always very prompt and extremely professional. If you want a professional, clean and attention to detail stylist Marcedes!!
