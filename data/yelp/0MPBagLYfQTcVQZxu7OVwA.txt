First! The Mesa Temple is a beautiful place.  It is a Holy place where families can be sealed together for eternity.  You can learn more about temples here: http://lds.org/church/temples?lang=eng.

A great place to walk around,  get information or watch videos on history of Mormon church.  Safe,  Beautiful and peaceful and for all faiths there is a visitors center and a large statute of Christ!
