Busy location, average service & speed.

Service usually sucks. Two order spots but never used. Coming in and out is so narrow surprised not more accidents.

the staff is always nice! I take my dog through the drive thru all the time. They pet him and sometimes even give him a french fry! which makes his day. My orders are always special and they always get it right!

Its McDonalds. With a playplace. It was clean.

I had 2 options for water a tiny 6 oz cup (yeah right) or pay full price (cost of pop) for a glass of water. Customer service is lost on the managers here. These are the basics and I'm tired of it.

You can expect: cold fries , gross or uncarbonated drinks , cold burgers that have been sitting there ect. I usually don't write reviews but with flu , fever , and gross food; I'll be going hungry tonight.  Save yourself a trip and go to Ellsworth.
