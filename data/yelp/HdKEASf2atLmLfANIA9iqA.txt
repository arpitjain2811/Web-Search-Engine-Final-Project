found it across from gate 9 at sky harbor. Ethiopian brew of the day made me a fan. Cream cheese danish was not too sweet and fair value.

Stopped in at their location at Terminal 2 near gate 9 prior to my flight.  The service was quick and professional and there was not a line. Iced or hot yoy will be pleased with quality typical of the chain.

You would do better walking across the hallway to Wendy's and getting coffee there. The Coffee Bean had no customers in line yet I had to wait 6 minutes to be waited on. While waiting I noticed they sell cans of chocolate powder topper to take home, but do you think they could put any out for customers who just purchased a large expensive cappuccino? You guest it NO. Maybe the chocolate powder would have helped improve the taste of their bitter coffee. Yuk! Just a captive audience.
