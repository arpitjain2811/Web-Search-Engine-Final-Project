Cindy does an awesome job on my two poodles. She does exactly what I ask her to do. She also has an area to wash the animals yourself.

Natalie dyed my dog ombr√© pink and I'm so in love! They are so nice and seem to genuinely care about the animals. They were very passionate and friendly. I was there 30 mins just chit chatting. It's a small family owned type of business run by a lady named Cindy. Natalie was very enthused about doing something creative which she says is her specialty.
