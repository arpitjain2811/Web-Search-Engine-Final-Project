Good grocery selection, poor service by deli, cashier, and bagger. Great service at bakery.

Things I love about this Fry's: The cute, slow little old people. The huge parking lot with the temptation of a Taco Bell within. The great selection of spendy La Brea Bakery Bread. Wednesday's. The vast inside with everything but the kitchen sink. Fresh lobster?! The cute, slow little old people.  Things I hate about this Fry's: The cute, slow little old people.

This store is one of my favorites, it is laid out so well and we enjoy all the older ladies that work the registers.  They are always so pleasant to work with, but the parking lot is my least favorite.  Everyone is zipping through so fast and there is always someone begging for money.
