Dr. Rizzo is an amazing surgeon. I understand bedside manner is a huge issue but come on he is a doctor dealing with people complaining all day. Before we sit here and write bad reviews lets remember we didnt go to school all those years and we are not in his shoes. He did my surgery years ago and am very thankful that i had such an amazing surgeon. Thank you Dr.Rizzo

Terrible service.  I had been there a few times and they were fine but for my last scheduled visit they were very rude.  I can't not recommend them enough.  There are three other choices in under a 5 mile radius, go to one of them, they'll at least treat you like a human being.  Its a shame too, I had actually grown to enjoy my visits there.
