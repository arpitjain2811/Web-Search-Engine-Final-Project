We had a problem with the igniter on our stove, it stopped working.  We called American Home Shield and they assigned A-1 Accurate to come out to complete the repair.  They were able to identify the problem within a few minutes and informed me that they had to special order a part. It took 2 weeks for the part to come in and for them to install it.  It didn't take them too long to get it done, now the stove works great. Overall, a pretty good experience.

Was called out to my elderly parents to repair refrigerator they were very nice and did not try to sell them something they didn't need, I am very thankful for their honesty.
