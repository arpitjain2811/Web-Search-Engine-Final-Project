Finding a good barber or hairstylist that will cut your hair the way you want is hard. It's almost like try on shoes, you have to keep searching until you find the one. I've been going to TJ Hair Design for the last several years for my hair cut and I've been pretty happy with the result.  Base on my observations, it seems that only two gals really have the talents to cut hair, others should not even be cutting hair in the first plac. So next time you want to give TJHD a try, I recommend either My or Tiffany, either one will do a good job.

I have been going here for about 2 years now. Tiffany is amazing! I have super long hair and whenever I go some place they end up chopping it off or not layering my hair properly. Tiffany makes sure to keep the length I desire with nicely blended layers!
