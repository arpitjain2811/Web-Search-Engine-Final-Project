It is often thought that this petrol, and diesel, station has the cheapest fuel in Edinburgh because of the amount of taxis which can be seen there at any time of day or night.  Apparently, this is not the case.  I have it on great authority, another taxi driver, that it's popular because drivers can sit and blether there. This other taxi driver called them fisherwomen, which I'm pretty sure has nothing to do with halibut. [EDIT: The cheapest fuel in Edinburgh, apparently, is at Morrisons & Sainsbury's who are in constant competition with each other ~ source, the same taxi driver.]
