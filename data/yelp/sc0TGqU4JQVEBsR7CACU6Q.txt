This studio is awesome! They offer great classes for all ages and the instructors are all really good. The owner, Melissa, is a teacher and ex Cardinal's cheerleader. Check this place out!

My 3-year old took some beginning dance classes here.  She absolutely loved it, and the owner Melissa!!  The class was great because they did about 20 minutes of ballet, 20 minutes of tap, and then 20 minutes of gymnastics.

Not much to say, but as a business owner myself, customer service is definitely everything! :)
