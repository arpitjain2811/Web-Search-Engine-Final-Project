Liz is the BOMB! :) No one is allowed to touch my hair except this gorgeous hair goddess; I will make the extra drive every time to see her and over half a decade later, she's still my one and only! She is simply AH-MAH-ZING!

I have been getting my hair cut & colored by Mia for years.  She is the most cheerful down to earth person you'll ever meet.  I am picky when it comes new color or cuts, but the next day after seeing her I am always ecstatic how awesome my hair looks and feels after trying something new.
