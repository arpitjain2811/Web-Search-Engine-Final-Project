It is a nice  store, but not enough employees to service the busy times.

I love this 7-Eleven because they have the most friendly attendants I've ever ran into. They are always quick to start a conversation, and to thank you for coming. You always leave with a smile! Best gas station in the Horizon Ridge area

Hey, go there like 2am and you most likely see the guy outside with some girl,who was sitting on a stool. Went in to get a hotdog. Right, they were dark in color and all wrinkled . Nice deal 1/4 lb.hotdog and chips too bad it was more like 1/4 lbeef jerky and chips. I walked out with nothing and went over to Timbers. I won't take a chance going there to get something fresh.
