Really friendly owners.  Empanadas are made right after you order them so you are not getting something that has been sitting around all day or something microwaved.  I have only had their mozzarella empanadas but they are good.  If you buy two empanadas you can also get a mate tea.  Usually parked in front of Memorial Library, rain/snow or shine.
