I'm not normally a chain coffee shop fan, much preferring to find that needle in a hay stack small, one of a kind cafe, but given the Gyle offers little in unique experiences, I've taken to frequenting Costa every now and then and, I must say, am pleasantly surprised. The coffees are consistently ok and the friendly service a standout. Not bad at all.

Cant pass up on a double shot latt√® & a linzer biscuit! Seating is very cramped though, so its 4/5 for this one...
