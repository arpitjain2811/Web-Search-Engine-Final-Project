It's a Target, what do you expect?  There's a grocery store, a Starbucks and a snack bar with really good popcorn.  It's all around, A-OK.  Except the popcorn, it's better than the movie theater bs. The staff is more meh than A-OK.  Once I was looking for stroller/carrier combo off a baby registry list which said there were 3 in stock.  When I couldn't find it I went back to customer service and they took the registry from me and pointed to the aisle.  When I told them it wasn't there and asked if they had more elsewhere, they said no.  On another visit I asked to be directed to the gift wrap aisle and I was told they didn't have one.  You're better off not asking questions when you come in here.

Usual Super Target. You can get just about anything here, and it's more upscale than Wal Mart. Haha

Target: One of the best places to check out the local attractive moms.

Staff here is extremely friendly. Starbucks inside is great to get before shopping. Better than most Targets I have been to.
