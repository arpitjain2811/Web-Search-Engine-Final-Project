My cocker spaniel, Sophie, looks so good! I can tell she feels good too. Katie used a gentle shampoo on her sensitive skin and had good feedback for me. Sophie's never come back from the groomer so happy or smelling so good. I already booked her next appointment!

I really wanted to give her 5 stars but her communication is so poor that I could only give her 3 stars. I live on the West side and typically take both of my dogs somewhere closer but I purchased a groupon for dog grooming to see if I like her.   I was very pleased with the end result. You could tell she treats the dogs very good and gave them each a doggie ascot, which made them look only more adorable.   However it was very hard to get her to respond to my multiple messages to schedule a haircut.  I have since decided to try her again but have not been able to get a timely response to my voicemail and no response to my email either.  Very frustrating.
