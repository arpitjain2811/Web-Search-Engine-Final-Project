Fun pub on Leith Walk with a good range of beverages behind the bar, albeit at city centre prices. Plenty of boardgames to while away a slow afternoon with too.

Really nice wee bar on leith walk. The atmosphere is very chilled, the staff are friendly and the music is good. Drinks selection is decent with black isle on tap.
