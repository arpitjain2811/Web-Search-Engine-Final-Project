What a fun place to hang out at the Westin Kierland.  Waltz & Weiser Saloon had something for everyone.  In our case it was drinks for the adults, shuffleboard and the rest of the resort for the kids and food for everyone.  Even billiards.  It's a little hard to find.  From the lobby you have to go through the lobby bar, down the stairs toward the golf course, then take a left just before you get outside and go almost to the end of the hallway.  Unlike the rest of the Westin, it's dark and cave-like.  A little more informal and comfortable.  Like the rest of the Westin, we had excellent service and pretty good food at premium resort prices in the upscale resort atmosphere.   Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a place to relax for a couple hours.

Great pub to grab a drink...either inside or outside on the patio!  They have shuffleboard and a pool table next door.

Cool bar with late night food.  The burger with green chile is pretty delicious.  Grab a drink and sit by the fire outside or hopefully you will catch the bag pipes guy at sunset.
