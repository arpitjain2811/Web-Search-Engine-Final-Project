Recently refurbished pub - much better decor and much cosier now than the previous Mezz Bar. We first went there twice the first week it opened - the food was good - very decent portion sizes! Good selections of drinks too. Only thing which could be better is the lady behind the bar - a wee smile here and there would be nice!

Atmosphere good - somewhere between 'traditional pub" and "shabby-chic bar". I was immediately happy with the nice selection of beers on tap, including several cask ales. Service at the bar was friendly and attentive.  We were there for an event which included large platters of finger foods - onion rings, nachos, chips, haggis balls, that kind of thing, which is not really my kind of thing, but they seemed to be done well enough. I'd definitely be up for a return trip to give the regular menu items a try while drinking more of their tasty ale.

I have no problem giving this place five stars.  When a place like this ticks all of the boxes, I really cannot think of anything they could add to push themselves higher.  Close to the centre, but far enough away from the maddening tourists.  Went in here to grab some food and drinks before Whisky Fringe.  It was quiet but the staff were excellent. Some really good beers behind the bar and excellent offers on beer and food combinations. I did not eat here but the folks that did enjoyed their meals.  Great decor, comfy seats.  I would not hesitate to stop in here when I am next through to Edinburgh.

Menu has promise but seemingly running out of Belhaven Best on a Friday night, being unable to serve a good quality pint of Deuchar's and describing McDonaldsesque fries as "rustic" chips means there's room for improvement.
