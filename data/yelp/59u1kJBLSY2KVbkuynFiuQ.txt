The selection in here; is much different than I've ever seen in las Vegas; they actually carry, litto gomez cigar and other popular smokes; even pre embargo cigars; priced fairly well. "Don't mean anything, if you don't smoke them; they're all round an brown" . Good spot.

Great customer service. We walk in and it's this little guy with glasses smoking a cigar, classic. He recommended a blueberry and vanilla cigar. Greatness is about to occur
