The prices are pretty reasonable and the fashions are super cute. But don't expect a great quality.  For younger crowds. We met one of the owners an she is super nice. Happy to support small businesses.

They have some cute stuff, it's not too expensive but the quality is not so good. I didn't see recognizable brands but what do you expect? There isn't a huge selection but it's all displayed nicely.   I get my lashes done next door at Axiom Spa and I always hear their music through the walls. It seemed that Hidden Attic was a fun party place so I decided to check it out. I was really annoyed with the loud hip hop/rap music. The use one of those mega base portable boom boxes. It was obnoxious.   I was not interested in buying or browsing too long and lost interest. I would love to spend more time browsing but I'm not 21 and at the club.  I think this place has potential.   Get a bit more stock. Be more friendly to your potential customers.  Turn down your music.  Avoid rap and stick with top 40 music.

Super cute stuff! Affordable prices. Staff is really nice and friendly. Offered to help me as I walked in the door. LOVE this store!  Definitely coming back.
