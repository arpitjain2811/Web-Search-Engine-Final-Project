Perfect. I searched for 10 years to find a place for fellowship and finally found it here. Their come as you are policy is truly what it means. You feel welcome and comfortable from the very start. The church is current and applicable to life today. I love the nonjudgmental attitude. This is truly a place to call home for fellow Christians and those wondering what Christianity is all about. This church is one that has finally gotten it right.

The Crossing is our home away from home.  We love it there, and are always blessed by the message and the music.  Thanks to Shane Philip, Lee Coate, and the great staff, we're a part of the Crossing family.

I love the daycare here for my baby. I used to take my son to the kids daycare and he loved it. We came here last week and compared to when we went last year, the whole vibe has changed. Although I love the ladies at the baby daycare, we might have to find another church.  We will give it another try and see if our feelings change.

This is my favorite house of worship in Vegas. I am very particular about churches I attend because I want to go somewhere that my family and I feel welcome and accepted. The have an open arm way of being and the teachings are straight from the bible, but applicable to today. Plus, the music is amazing.  Also, I know first hand that they actually help people in the community without making them feel judgement or guilt.  I can't say enough good things about the Crossing.
