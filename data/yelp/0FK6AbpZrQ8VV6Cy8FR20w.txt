Clean and organized, found some cheap items that I was looking for.

This Dollar Tree was MUCH better then others I have tried in the area. The location was twice the size of two others I've been to, and the choices were more plentiful.  I was striking out on the Halloween decorations at Dollar Tree - which was my go to place in Orlando for seasonal decor - so I was pretty bummed about it.  However, this one was the winner and helped to set me up for some cute desk deco! I was able to find several items to my liking for our office theme since they had more options overall (I'm guessing since they were a larger location in general).  I am considering stopping back by this one to stock up on a few more things now that I have the decor started on my desk and I have more ideas! Overall: A Bigger location.  More options.  Everything is still only $1.
