It deserves a 4-star for both the food and the service! The fries are on-par or probably sub-par but it is not the point of this place though!

They have some great Gyros for great prices. The staff that own and run the place are super friendly as well. Definitely a great place if you're looking for a quick bite to eat on the east side.

It's a gas station!  It's a gyros shop! It's a Zizo!   Aren't you glad Zizo Cafe is also a character from Dr. Seuss Would you could you with a fox?  Would you could you in a box?  Zizo Zazu what?   I am not sure how they came upon Zizo but it is a fun little place tucked away on the North side in a cute metal grey box! Lamb gyros were recommended, so hit me up with a side of fries.  Friendly family service, a the place never slowed down even on a late lunch. You know you are at the right stop when the full kaleidoscope of people are here.   Me, the busdriver, a professor, an elderly couple are all in the same tight little spot eating gyros. Just a few tables so don't bring 20 friends.  It's attached to the gas station, so fill up the tummy and then the car.
