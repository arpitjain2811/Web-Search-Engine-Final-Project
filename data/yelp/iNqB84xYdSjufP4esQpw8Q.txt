This is a very nice barber shop. I felt very welcomed. I have two boys with two very different texture hairs. My youngest (6) wanted a frohawk and my oldest (10) wanted a mini Afro. Mr.Shea did a great job.

I used to work with Mr Shea. I decided to go to his barber shop after cutting my own hair for the past 20 years or so. I wanted a new bald fade. I previously called earlier in the week to make an appointment on Saturday. Tank ended up cutting my hair. Excellent job! Will be going back every two weeks!
