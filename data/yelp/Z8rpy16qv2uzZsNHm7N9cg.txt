Your typical Wendy's. The servers here are friendly and the restaurant is clean. My burger came perfectly assembled! Staff was a bit flustered behind the counter but I did get my meal in minutes as promised. And with a smile too :-) Awesome!

food is good, quick delivery, good price. was able to sit and relax while eating my food. Cashiers were friendly and brought me my food within minutes of ordering which was good.
