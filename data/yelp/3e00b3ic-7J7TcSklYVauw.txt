Pick Up Stix is another "fast" Chinese restaurant.  Not as fast as a Panda Express, but more like a Pei Wei with a more casual atmosphere.  The give very generous portions, with lots of veggies.  I frequently order sweet and sour chicken at any Chinese restaurant, and this was one of the best.

This place is like any other takeout Chinese place, only it has the clean, slightly less greasy feel of a chain, with the prices and expediency of a independently owned restaurant. I strongly recommend the lunch special, which gets you a drink, rice, lunch portion of (some chicken dish), and an appetizer for $6.99.  The food isn't exceptional enough for the fifth star, but the prices and convenience almost get it there.

Pick Up Stix is not as popular as some of the other fast Chinese restaurants but is still very good. For first timers who are not sure what to get, go with the "House Chicken" it is incredible and happens to be there specialty. The lunch special is hard  to beat that Jake C. mentioned. The only bad part is that it only includes the "House Chicken" so for the few of you out there who don't like it might be out of luck. If you are picking up, be sure to call a head because you might be waiting for a while otherwise.
