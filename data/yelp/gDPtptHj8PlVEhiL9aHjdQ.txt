All I can say is...  I love you for existing and hate you at the same time. Sigh, I miss my skinny jeans ;)

Located in a small and unassuming old strip mall on North Decatur is the kind of gem that can easily be overlooked, yet has stood the test of time (now in their second decade). Although the "tripa" has really been a standout, so far we have not found a taco that would not be ordered again, with each being well thought out in preparation, and generous in the meat portions. A four taco "combination" comes with a basket of chips while you are waiting, which can be used to try the different concoctions from their salsa bar. Have not gone beyond the tacos yet, because they simply are so damn good. You can see in the presentation, and taste on the palate, just how much these folks care about their product.
