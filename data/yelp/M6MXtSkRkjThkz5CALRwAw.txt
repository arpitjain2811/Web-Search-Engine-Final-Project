I usually come here when I want to ship something quickly instead of running all the way to the post office, it's usually not too busy and staff are friendly.

I've only had copies made here, so idk about the rest of their services, however I can tell you the copy machine is the worst. It leaves a black line down the left side of the page on every copy. I use these copies for work and need them to look semi professional. I always try to support locally owned small businesses like thisone it's a shame I can't!
