My friends and I shopped here for some alcohol to take back to our hotel room.  I was in the middle of shopping, and I had to take a shit.  You see, I'm not shit shy.  I'll take one anywhere.  Anyway, I had to go so I gave my friends money for my portion of the liquor and headed for the restrooms.   I have to say, the restrooms were actually very clean for a grocery store.  I did my do, or doo doo (shall I say) and left.  I was pleasantly surprised by my bathroom experience there. Great place to shop and shit.  :)

3.5 A designated gambling area in a legit super market? I've seen it all. Aside from the time share we stayed in, I have to say Food-4-less really saved us dough when staying in Vegas. In town for a bachelor & bachelorette get-a-way and conveniently located just a few blocks from the resort were they able to support our alcoholic addiction for a lot less. Some wanted beer, some wine and other's just liquor. Thanks F4L you helped whet each one of our whistle's.

There is not, nor has there ever been a Food For Less at this address or map location. I'm not sure how to let Yelp know this, just posting it here instead.
