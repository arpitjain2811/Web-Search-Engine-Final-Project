Friendly staff.  I was a walk in, waited a bit for a spa pedicure but who can complain sitting in a massage chair.  Vanessa did a cute french pedicure w a requested flower.  It was relaxing and a nice environment.  The staff was always asking if I was comfortable and even provided water. Will be back.

This is a fabulous place!!  Super clean which is always a plus.  I was a walk in and I got in right away no waiting.  The gal that did my pedicure was awesome, she is a perfectionist which I most appreciate. I am going back for my manicure next.

In a city with nail salons on every corner, customer service is essential. Being the newest, "nicest" salon isn't enough. Had the worst experience here with my son - the owner was beyond rude and treated us like crap. The lady that did my nails was awesome, unfortunately his behavior was atrocious. Total jerk.
