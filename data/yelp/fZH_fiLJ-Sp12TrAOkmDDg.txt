Just like any tech school, you will only learn the basics. Then you have to grow up and learn the trade on the job! Place really gave me a direction of where I want to go in life. Not saying this is the best place to go, it was hard. But life is hard!

I never attended this school, however the school fraudulently took out student loans in my name and social security number. I am from California, never have lived in Arizona. I am nurse, not interested in Automotive anything...my car goes in tot he shop for low tire pressure! They are ripping people off!
