An almost 'blink and you'll miss it' cafe with superb views of the castle, Blackcherry is a brilliant little place for a coffee and a chat in a relaxed and charming atmosphere.  Food is locally sourced and generally brilliant although I have had a few occaions which i have been slightly dissapointed - but I have always returned, because the food is outstanding when they get it right, so it is worth the risk. Blackcherry is a great little place to spend some time relaxing and generally just watching the world go by.

I came to Blackcherrys with some mates after a flat party near the Grassmarket earlier this year.  We were all feeling pretty rough, tired and peckish.  Luckily we came across this little cafe which offers delicious breakfast rolls all morning.  I went for a sausage and egg butty which was the perfect antidote to the hangover and - almost - made me feel normal again.  It only cost about Â£2.50 which is a bit of a bargain considering the area and the sausages were great quality and cooked to perfection.   You get an enlightening view of the castle from inside Blackcherry as well and it'd be an ideal place to chill out with a cup of coffee and a cake.  The staff were cheery and the service was pretty quick, despite our visit coinciding with the pre-work rush.   I'd definitely come here again as they have a great range of food and drinks as well as a nice setting to enjoy them in.
