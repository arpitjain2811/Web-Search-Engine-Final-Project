This is good when you are on the road and stopping for fuel.  If there was any other fast food restaurant around I would choose them hands down over subway.

Prompt and friendly service.  Food was no different from any other Subway I've visited.  Our only problem was that the AC was cranked so much that it was COLD inside the restaurant.
