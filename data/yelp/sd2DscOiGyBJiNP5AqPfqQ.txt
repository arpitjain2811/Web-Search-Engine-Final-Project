I occasionally stop into this Goodwill from time to time, and its probably my least favorite location.  I never find much of anything worth buying, and the selection seems to be poor here.  Most times I walk out empty handed, despite there being a store full of stuff to buy. Sadly, not my preffered location, but still good to do a donation at when I need to drop stuff off.  If you want to have a better selection of stuff to buy, choose another goodwill.  Limited selection of stuff to by across the board.

Crazy long lines, walked out as soon as I walked in.  Maybe I just caught them on a bad day...

Since the move to the other side of this plaza, this Goodwill is more spacious, and can hold more items.  Clothes are separated by color, and there is always a large selection of household goods and electronics and knick-knack type stuff.  The half-price Saturdays can't be beat!

This is actually the former location of this Goodwill Store.  I think it was about a year ago that it moved around the corner in the same shopping center to a larger, nicer location.  I used to come in this one but don't remember being real impressed.  I like the newer one. It's more spacious and usually more organized, depending on how many idiots go in and let their kids run wild in the store, taking things down, ripping open bags, losing pieces to games and toys, and leaving clothes all over.
