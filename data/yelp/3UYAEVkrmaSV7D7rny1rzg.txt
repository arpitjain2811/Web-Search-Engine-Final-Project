I have been to plenty of indian restaurants in my life, and taken away from many more. Sonar Gao is top 3 for sure.  An unassuming little shop run by a tiny balding bangladeshi man Sonar Gao doesn't look impressive in the slightest but god damn the food is good. it arrives when you want it, and loads of the dishes come with a side for free, like the katmandhu which comes with a free plain naan. The menu is pretty extensive, offering all the usual fare like khorma's and such, but also offers curry dishes that are a little off the beaten path. The Chicken Zheera is a favourite of mine with a Peshwari naan is back of the net food for me. Sonar Gao's Lime Pickle is also a surprise treat. Not as thick and unmaleable as Pattak's it's easy to mix with other sauces, or drizzle on a puppadom, but still has a hell of a sour kick with a warmth of chilli. If you're in the delivery Radius, next time you want a take away curry try this place out.
