I followed my trainer, Carolyn Vanzlow-Edgar, to this gym. She made an excellent choice. All of the equipment we need is here, without the glam machines. A serious place to get the job done.

I came to train with Marcus Nash after seeing the results of my friends that go to him. After 1 month I've seen more changes in my body then I ever did working out on my own. He is so motivating and changes your workouts so you're never bored. Gym is super clean and never crowded. I love it so much I will never go anywhere else.
