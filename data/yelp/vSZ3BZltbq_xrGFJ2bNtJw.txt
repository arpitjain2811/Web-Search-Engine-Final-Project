So I have been getting my lashes done for about 6 months and I recently moved to Vegas. That being said I had to find a new lash chick and she by far is the best, even better than the girl I had in AZ.

Lindelle did my lashes the other day and I can say with confidence that I LOVED them! They turned out fuller and better looking than I could remember before.  She's efficient with her time and very friendly.  To top it off, she's more affordable than a certain chain in town I've been going to, but with better quality work.  I've gotten a lot of compliments since our session and will definitely be coming back :) Thanks, Lindelle!!
