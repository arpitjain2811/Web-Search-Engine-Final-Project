I am a firm believer of "you get what you pay for."  I have been in this store twice and am impressed with their service and selection of sofas.  Sure, they may be more expensive but the sofas come with a lifetime warranty on workmanship and materials and are custom designed to your specifications.   The sofas themselves are very solidly built. Their cutaway illustrates how well built these sofas are right down to the frame.  They have a huge selection of leather colors for you to choose from to fit your decor and will deliver the sofa anywhere in the country.

What a helpful and friendly store. Mike immediately understood what I wanted and found me an excellent color and grade of leather for two sofas. Unfortunately I won't see the actual product for 6-8 weeks. But judging by the furniture on display, I shouldn't be disappointed.
