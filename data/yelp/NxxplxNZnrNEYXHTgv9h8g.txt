I love Bongo.  Staff is very knowledgeable and always helpful.  Movies are cheap, especially if you go with the bongo bundle or the prepaid card (I forget the details, but I think it's something like 10 movies for $24 or so).  I prefer Bongo to Netflix because I feel I end up getting movies that I'm in the mood to watch.
