At first I was hesitant about visiting a doctor. I normally deal with pain on my own, but after having sleepless nights with shoulder pain,  I was  recommended to visit Dr. Wamboldt.  I was extremely happy with the service and the friendly staff. I was in and out quickly, my shoulder pain is gone, and I haven't had problems since I saw him a year ago. I highly recommend Dr. Wamboldt for any sports injury, and I've heard he is great with ortho issues.

Good first office visit. Seems to be a caring Doc and did NOT try to talk me into surgery.

I was very impressed both with Dr Wamboldt and his staff.  He was attentive, asked lots of questions and then actually LISTENED to the answers.  Spent lots of time with me.  His staff is great.  Needed appt right away andd they even called me back when they had an appt.  Friendly and helpful
