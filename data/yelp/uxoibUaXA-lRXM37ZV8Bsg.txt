Absolutely horrendous.  This post office will lose your mail (repeatedly), laugh about it to your face, lie about it, blow it off, make it seem like it's your fault and make you wish you had sent it UPS.

Your typical post office.  The lines can get long, but really, I have seen much longer lines at other post offices. I mainly go to this place because I have a P.O. Box there. Tip: to avoid lines when mailing a package, go to on of the independent mail places.  There is a good one up the street on the SW corner of 7th St. and Thunderbird.

It's the post office....could the customer service have been better? Absolutely. Could it have been worse? Absolutely. I believe this is a dying bread anyway, unfortunately.
