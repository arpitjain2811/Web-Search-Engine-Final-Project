Pretty nice place to eat at. Yes, really. Everything looks really new, the dine-in number signs are clean, and the menu even looks different than the one back at home. Couple issues with them not getting the drinks right in our order... didn't take down the request for "an additional coffee" on top of the one in the value meal, and didn't give me the orange juice that was in the order until I reminded them later. Also, it seemed a little slow even compared to normal...

One of my go-to's!

Food was up to par but an employee in the dining room ruined our experience.  She was on her cell phone during her break being so ridiculously loud. We could barely hear our own conversations.  Completely unprofessional and probably an indication of managements policies. Won't come again.
