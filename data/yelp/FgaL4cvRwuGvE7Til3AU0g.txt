Tiffany is awesome, I own a local Moving company and the heavy sometimes kills the back. Tiff is always available when I need her skills. Thanks Lady!!!! I'll be seen you soon enough.

My office uses The Back Rub Co for bi-weekly massages. My co-workers and I LOVE our regular massage therapist Pat. We have many testimonies of cured aches and pains. She also takes the time to teach us stretches and new ways to do our daily work and activities. They also provide fantastic massages outside an office setting. As an athlete I have lots of muscle issues. Heidi, at the PHX location, did an amazing job working out the cycling kinks in my upper back.
