Bought a small travel trailer from Tom's.  Matt was our salesman and was great...very no-pressure and helpful with any questions.  2 years later I needed help with a copy of the invoice from my purchase...Matt faxed it to me in no time.   Talk about great customer service!  And the trailer is great too!

Such a great experience shopping for trailers here. Helpful, no-pressure, no-rush.  Salesman Dave was great. What a difference compared to our first RV shopping stop (see other review)! I will update review once we actually purchase.

I came in today to look at the T@Bs and I spoke with Matt Duncan the general manager.  He was awesome!! I asked a million questions and he took the time & answered all of them; he didn't seem rude and definitely had patience for me so that was great. I am definitely buying one this yr  and hopefully he will still be there.  They were great; if you're looking for a tab or on rpod this is the place to buy them.
