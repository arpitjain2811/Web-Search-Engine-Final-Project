I'm hungry just thinking about this place. Wow. Its a little hard to find and maybe to get to but in the end, its well worth it. I like this place. A nice change of pace from all the ultra-french in this city.

Susprisingly good considering they had Thai, Japanese and I am sure other Asain cusines all on the same menu.  Or maybe it was the fact that I was with a super hottie that night who distracted me from my meal. Either way, I left feeling full and happy so I can't complain - price wasn't outrageous either for a place in the Venetian.

5 stars is for the ambiance, the food, and the mood.  Had a great time here.  Ordered a simple rice and orange chicken dish.  They also have sushi here.  Very modern decor and lighting was dark, yet subtle.  Asked my girl to be my girlfriend here, so that may have biased my opinion just a bit.  But now this place will always be a special spot.
