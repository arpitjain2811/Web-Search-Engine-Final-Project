This place is a tucked away family owned business that has great service and everything is always fresh. The only bad thing about this place is that it closes early.

I recently discovered this sub shop from someone at work. They have really great subs, but I didn't really like their macaroni salad so I gave it to a co-worker. I had soup from there too, and it was yummy!

If you are in the area this is a great hidden delight, The ingredients are the freshest I have had before the "Lettuce, tomatoes, Onions" etc are worth trying even if you do not normally care for them.

After hearing about this place from a few coworkers, my friend and I decided to go grab some subs for lunch today. How did i survive so long on my crappy work cafeteria food when this was 2 mins away???  Its great, its a hidden little spot right off of 24th street with amazingly fresh food and speedy service. Not only that, but the cost is super cheap! The mini subs are in the 3 dollar range and are perfect for lunch. We will be back...many, many times.
