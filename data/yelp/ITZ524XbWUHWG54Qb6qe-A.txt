A pricy place in the airport. However we liked the club salad. And they turned it over fast for us. Good lookin' beer selection too.

As airport bars go, it's not too bad. food is a little more expensive than city pubs but there's nearly always some sort of ale/beer on offer.  Can't go too wrong with this place

If you enjoy paying $20 for a dry, tasteless burger with a wee bit of wilted lettuce and poor service to boot, this is a perfect place to dine. Otherwise one could do equally well at any BK and save a few quid. Had such a lovely time in Edinburgh, shame to leave on such a disappointing note.
