I took my mother in law for lunch she had the meatloaf sandwich and I had a bacon cheese burger food was great and prices were reasonable we could not leave until we bought cookies and Bavarian brownies you must try them.  We will go back.

Yum we stopped in here on our way out to boulder city. It was a nice family owned and operated place with a "support our troops" theme. They had fresh baked goods.I ordered a ham sandwich and my honey had a Ruben and we ordered some fried zucchini . it was delish. My ham sandwich was simple and fresh, the Ruben was greasy and cheesy. The zucchini was perfect. They brew there own tea and it was all 16$. will defiantly be back soon when were over in old Henderson.
