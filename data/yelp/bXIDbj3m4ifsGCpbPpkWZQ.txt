Good location, but not really accessible if you're headed East on Elliot. Parking lot is often full and parking is limited. Good, fresh coffee. Store typically clean and fairly busy too.

This Circle K has friendly employees and you can't beat the 79Â¢ soda. I must consume 3 of these day. It is pretty clean compared to most Circle K locations I've been to.

I am here almost daily. I walk here all the time and this store helps me gain weight. The 79. sodas is what really gets me all the time. LOVE IT!

The people who work here are friendly and the soda fountain is always on point. I can't say the same for other locations.

I like the convenience of this location. It is in a good spot and easy to access from Elliot or Hardy. They also always have fresh coffee already when I am there. The reason for the 3 star is that it is a crowded interior, and not as up to date as other locations I have visited. It's ok from a selection standpoint, but could use some renovation to make the interior more appealing.
