One of the reasons I love this store is he staff. With all the budget cuts casinos have taken I'm surprised this store hasn't had any. I love this one woman Annaliza. She is fast, knows her clients and their body-types, and points you to their best sale items.  Next best thing: SALES. I just shopped at 75% off retail---the stores down the strip at the mall can't beat these prices. Their selection is nice and with dirt cheap prices I know I will be back again soon.

Sweet!   Gal pals and I stumbled in hereafter a long lunch.  Perfect swimsuits for the Roman Styled Bellagio pool!  We wrapped ourselves in sarongs of turquoise and gold.  I have since returned to Capri each time Ifind myself inVegas.  The sale rack can,t be beat, and the salesladies know their stock! I got a perfect charming yet sophisticated faux chinchilla and embroidered vest for my fashionista Mom for Christmas!  I scored a Michael Kors camouflage top covered in transparent sequins last summer that Paraded around all over Europe last summer, casual, yet iconic.  I am hoarding a blue and white Ikat pattern top to pull out for the first summer breeze, along with a tiered white skirt. Perfect mix of siren and classic to bringoutthegoddess in you!
