This Great Clips has been here ever since I was born, which was '86. It is the only place I have gotten my haircut ever and I have never had a problem with them messing it up.

I love this Great Clips.  I always call ahead and make sure Annalisa is working.  She does a really good job on my long, thick hair.  First time I came in, I knew I just wanted something new.  Some more volume, some more texture.  She gave me great layers and a style that's easy going.  So lucky I found her.  I've been seeing her for a couple years now.  Everyone else there seems pretty cool, too.
