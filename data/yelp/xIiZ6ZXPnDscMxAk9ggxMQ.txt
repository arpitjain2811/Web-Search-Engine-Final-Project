Saw this place while parking to get hair cut at franchise chain.  Decided to go here instead. Glad I did. Great local barbershop.  Very friendly.  Haircut price in line with competition.  Nice local owned business.  I didn't have cash on me and she said, "no problem, I'm here until six, just come back and pay me".  I did find some in my wallet but...how often do you hear that?

Great haircut, reasonably priced, friendly and fast service, and conveniently located.  What more can you ask for?

Conveniently located on Odana road. I got lucky and didn't have to wait long. The next person who had to come in had to come in the next day. It's a good idea to call in first and confirm Sandy's schedule. I showed Sandy pictures of the haircut I wanted and I think she was able to follow through, moderately priced, fast and simple cut.

Posting a quick update: I'm pretty much a regular now, it's just like all the other reviews said: Sandy is fast, cheap but attentive and very nice. She sometimes also keeps the store open past normal hours if there's an appointment too! Highly recommended.
