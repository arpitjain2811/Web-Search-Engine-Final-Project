These guys make a pretty good pizza. The crust is like a butter flake pastry, so delicious. Pepi's is better know for their subs, it's a must try.

You know what makes the difference between a good pizza and a great pizza?  There are a lot of factors, but I say that one of the big ones is the toppings.  Pepi's Pizza has always been a favourite at our house because they put lots of great toppings on the pizza, and they don't skimp!  Add to that hot and fast delivery and you've got a recipe for success!

Excellent pizza not near as greasy as it used to be. The only thing stopping me from giving them 5 stars is price is expensive and delivery times are not always the best.  Keep in mind the toppings are excellent quality which accounts for the price and as the price is what it is they don't do as many deliveries as a bigger chain so no need for more drivers. Again excellent pizza and the cheese is great!

Hands down THE BEST gluten free pizza crust.   I have tried the rest, this is simply the best and combine that with the high quality toppings....superb, great work.
