I like that QT workers are so friendly and efficient. I love that QT has a milkshake station...strawberry, mmm. I loathe the fact that this particular QT is lacking a filtered water option at the soda fountain area. Alternatively they direct you to a utility sink off by the bathroom, which I'm positive was not the filtered water they claimed it to be. Yuck!

Cleanest establishment. So many drinks to choose from! Good gas, list goes on & on....

I don't know how this Quick Trip location doesn't have 5 stars?!?!?! I am there just about every weekday morning & not only is this place CRAZY clean but there is ALWAYS someone attending to the floors or the drink machines or restocking hot foods/baked goods...!!! I appreciate seeing the same faces with their customary "Welcome to QuickTrip!" The morning manager is Ethan & he is definitely the guy QT management should be sending all of their trainees to!

Clean. Good prices. Tasty food. Friendly service. Not sure what else you are wanting from a gas station.
