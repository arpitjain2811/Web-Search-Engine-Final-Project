Jeff:  This is where we take the van before every tour.  Tom personally inspects and does all the repairs.  He is honest, gives a fair price and is an all around nice guy.  Tom always remembers you and your vehicle history and that rules. Chris:  I take my car here whenever I need anything done.  He's very honest and tells you what needs to be done or what can wait.  Looking for a guy you can trust?  Tom's your man.  As a bonus he has a killer stash. Ryan:  I've never been there but I've heard good things.  I don't have a car and I don't live in Arizona.

Been having Tom service our cars for years now. He provides excellent service, is completely honest, and has a fair price. He went way above the call of duty once helping us with a dispute when we mistakenly took a car, due to convenience, to another shop. Cannot recommend Tom highly enough.
