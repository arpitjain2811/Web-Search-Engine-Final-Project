My wife went to this salon and absolutely loved the result!!! The stylist, Ghada, listened to what she wanted and did a superb job in doing the perfect highlights (color and thickness) and cut. She hasn't found a good salon since we've moved here from San Francisco. I would definitely recommend this place, we'll both be going back!!!

I have been going to Ghada for over 15 years.  My husband and I laugh because I've been with her almost as long as I've been married to him.   Ghada is a true professional in every way.  Courteous, polite, fair, very reasonably priced and a real genius with color.  I can't even begin to count the number of times over the years that complete strangers have stopped me to compliment me on my color, cut or both.  Do yourself a favor and give Ghada a try.
