Just an average Jack....nothing real special about it. It is in a decent locale if your looking for something fast to eat....otherwise....again...nothing special. Also be advised if you have a Jack card and want you points.....make sure they swipe it BEFORE THEY TAKE YOUR ORDER....or you will not receive any points for your transaction. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!

Very friendly lady at the front who took my order, accepted my birthday coupon and was very sincere in wishing me a happy birthday.  Thanks so much for making me smile!
