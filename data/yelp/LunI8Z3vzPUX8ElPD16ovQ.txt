Johnjay and Rich in the Morning is absolutely Amazing!! i love it....  they are so funny, out of the box original....  I've honestly not laughed so hard in my car driving to work ..alone... in a long time...  i started listening to them regularly about 4 months ago and i have yet to regret it.... the topics they come up with are great, and the callers are ...well... they make you laugh for one reason or another... that's on you what for lol  the only downer is the occasional repeat of the same songs throughout the day... but its radio sadly it happens....  On the other hand the mix of the music is great and helps me get through my day :)  Take a Listen ....

I avoid all clearchannel stations. Johnjay and Rich are garbage blah blah blah. Kid and Ruben made that station. Now it's just sorry and tired!

This station plays more of the music I like than any of the stations in Chicago.

Billed as the #1 Hit Music Station, KISS FM is on my regular rotation when flipping through the channels.   It's a radio station that I can only handle in small bursts....if I listen to it too long, I feel like I'm Bill Murray in Groundhog's Day.  It's very predictable and you are guaranteed to hear a song come on at least 4 times per hour. The music they play are the top songs on the charts, so it's not too bad most of the time.  Just like any other station, I tune out as soon as a DJ starts yapping.  I listen to the radio for the music. Return Factor - 60%
