Staffed by the lovely Katie N, the Yelp stall at the Foodies Festival was a welcome respite to the craziness that was the rest of the festival! Friendly as always, Katie did a great job at engaging new people and getting lots of sign-ups, and there were great Yelp giveaways that everyone seemed to love, especially the reusable bags and lip glosses. The only thing I'd suggest would be a wee colorful Yelp banner for behind the table to catch people's attention since, besides the table, the area looked a tad plain compared to the others. I think this would bring more people in! It would also be really cool if there were a laptop available for new people to use to sign up and review the festival as a way of engaging them to write their first review if they wanted to do so on the spot.
