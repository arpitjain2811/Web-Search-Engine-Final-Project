How hard is it to get a decent review for dry cleaning? Drop off clothes, pick it, looks clean, BAM 3-4 stars right.  Drop off clothes, seems clean.  Crease on suit is not the same place so the crease looks off now.  Alterations: don't go here for that, I had them sew up a pocket on dress pants that seem to be coming loose. I got it back and it looked half down, missing a stich like the other pocket that was not ripped.  She responds " I am not a miracle worker"  WTH does that mean, it's a stich on a machine not parting the red sea.  Attitude with bad service = bad review.

They're close, nice, and professional. What else can you ask for.
