I finally got to try this place out. Rand had told me about it but you can't really know until you try for yourself. The help was friendly and so on.... when it comes to fast food two things decide 4 me Food vs. Price. The Burger I got was Juicy and wonderful I ordered a combo and it was like $8 and change. Not much else to report folks. =)
