I wanted to write a great review for this company because they deserve it!. Lanette Richmond, the owner is a top quality business owner.She truly cares about all of her clients, customers and her employees.I believe her and her maid/cleaning services to be the best in the area.She is always looking for new and better ways of running her business.Its nice to know you can call the owner and she will actually call you back and handle any questions or concearns you might have.Its rare to find people in the service industry that stand behind thier word and their work.I trust her 100% as should you.
