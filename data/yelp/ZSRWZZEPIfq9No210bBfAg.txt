This place is delicious! This family owned restaurant is new in Las Vegas, but I can tell already its going to do great. Fresh seafood, very tasty and the portions were just right. We will definitely come back!

Para los conocedores del sabor veracruzano, no hay mejor lugar que el camarón jarocho, sobre todo el cocktail de camarones y las picadas ( antojito típico de Veracruz ).  Como sugerencia, faltan meseros y un poquito más rápido el servicio.
