WOW!!! Amazing customer service! I was stressing out because I was unable to get my résumé in the correct format, my word had expired and I needed the résumé printed on good professional paper. The lady working helped me with ALL of this! She put my résumé in the right format, she emailed me a new copy, she even printed it on professional paper. Incredible!! I never would have thought that I was going to be helped the way she helped me. I am incredibly bummed that I didn't grab her name, it was my fault because she had a name tag on.  I can say that every time I go in to this location, they are always so nice to us. I am so thankful that the location is nearby and that all the employees are so accommodating. If it wasn't for the girl that helped me, I may not have been able to apply for a promotion.  Kudos to Southern Highlands UPS Store!!!
