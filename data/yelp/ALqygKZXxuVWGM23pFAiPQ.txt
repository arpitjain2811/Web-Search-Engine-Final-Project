Tiny little Dairy Queen which now sells Orange Julius drinks.  Got a julius to go.  I don't think they've quite perfected making them, because my julius drink was missing some key components, making it taste like a sugary slushie rather than a frothy, light drink.  The mango pineapple flavor of the julius itself was more mango, not so much pineapple, and as mentioned before, tasted overwhelmingly sweet (Probably because my drink was just syrup and crushed ice).

Yeah, I love Blizzards. Unfortunately the price keeps going up and up and the newer mini size is a total rip off. Gotta say I've never tried their food, and I have no real desire to.

Stop advertising iron-grilled sandwiches if your grill has been broken for FIVE months!  I complained via the DQ website and received a well-written letter from the franchise owner.  In his letter, he said that the grill had been replaced and enclosed two coupons for a free iron-grilled sandwich.  When I used the coupons, in two different visits, both times, the sandwiches were served on toasted bread, not iron-grilled.  The second time I was told that the iron grill didn't work,  WTF?  Fix the damn grill or take it off the menu.  I mean seriously.
