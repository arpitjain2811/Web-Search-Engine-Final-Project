This review is for the shuttle ride to the Sh*tty Barn in Spring Green. Hop Head offers this service to and from the Barn for shows, leaving from various locations in Madison (this time, we left from Alchemy).  The shuttle was prompt in picking us up at Alchemy. The inside was clean and spacious (there were about 14 seats) and the driver played good music on the way out. The shuttle left to return to Madison 10 minutes after the last band finished their set.  $20 for one person may seem like a lot, but it's much cheaper than a DUI! Simple purchase with minimal service fees through Brown Paper Ticket.

My wife and I have been on three trips so far with Hop Head Tours.  Two overnight trips, and one day trip.  I can't begin to say enough good things about this tour company.  Justin & Philipe go above and beyond to ensure their clients are having a great time. Whether it's a day trip to a couple of Madison area breweries, or a weekend trip to Western Michigan to visit their fine breweries, Hop Head Beer Tours is the way to go.  Well worth the money!!

We had a fantastic tour to Lake Louie, Platteville's Badger Bar, Potosi's Brewing Museum & back to Vintage Brewing.  Well organized, even had activities on the bus to help while away the time.
