Chip and Ruby's is such a cute place!  It has ice cream cone chairs and fun games to play!  The staff was so nice to accommodate my daughter's birthday party of 25 people dropping by...they had balloons and made a special huge sunday with candles and even lead the singing... Now let's get down to business...:)  The ice cream rocks!  The scooped ice cream is all fresh and home made and really natural and delicious.  It is served in really cool cone cup dishes...and although I'm not a quantity food person...I was glad the portions are large! They have custard there and I'm looking forward to coming back soon and trying it!

Awesome place for kids and the young at heart. Try the custard while the kids are playing midway games.
