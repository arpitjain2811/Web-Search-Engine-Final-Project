This is actually a Shell gas station with a CircleK convenience store. I like this Gas station because it's never crowded, has a lot of pumps, and it's convenient to get to. The Market is always clean and has a fairly good beverage/coffee station.

Cheapest Shell gas in the valley!  Usually .10 cheaper than other stations. Clean!  Never a wait for a pump!   Bonus - There's a Wells Fargo ATM outside the Circle K.

One of the least expensive gas stations in the area. It's both a Shell Gas Station and Circle K. A big benefit is getting inexpensive gas with the appropriate additives in the gas. Honda recommended this station because you should see a improvement in miles per gallon versus poorer gas mileage from other Circle K gas stations that uses a poorer quality gas with not the appropriate additives.
