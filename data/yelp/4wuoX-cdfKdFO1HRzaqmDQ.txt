Mike showed up on time and was able to fix my KitchenAid ice maker in short order.

I called Mike to repair our Kitchen Aid refrigerator.  He was able to fit the repair call in his schedule and was very prompt.  He offered me options with regards to the repair as well as his professional opinion.  Mike is a highly experienced professional and brings years of expertise.  I feel the fees were very fair for the work that was required and would not hesitate to call Mike again.

They came fast and fixed it quick, but the guy must have been having a bad day. The owner himself came out and was completely rude, and had an attitude the entire time, He insulted my landlord and when I put him on the phone he totally denied saying he was a crazy guy. We actually got into a nasty argument, but he refused to leave without his 70 dollar service charge. Fair enough. He ended up fixing it and charged 235 for a defrost thermostat. FYI, it's cheaper if you pay cash.
