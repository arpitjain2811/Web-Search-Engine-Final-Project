I came to this location while waiting for some car repairs. Ordered a side of hash browns and got some work done on the computer. Customer service from the counter was superb, and the place was spotless. Very impressed.

I only ordered two sandwiches to go and it took forever to come out . then they walked around with it on a tray calling out a number for an order I never received because they didn't give me a receipt. They finally bagged it up and sent us on our way with a 'sorry bout that'.Our sandwiches werent hot but they were,luckily, delicious.
