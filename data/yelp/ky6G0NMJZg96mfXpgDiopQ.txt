Sarah did an awesome job on my mirco braids. She was very fast and efficient and does exactly the way you request it. She provides the hair too. Very reasonable, flexible schedule, affordable prices. I will be most definitely returning soon.

My first kinky twist. I loved it, received many compliments. I tried another person and my husband said go back to the original ladies.  You will not be disappointed.  Ask for Sara.

I am hooked! Since the first time that I had my hair braided here, I knew that I would be coming back. Sarah is the best braider and she doesn't take all day getting you out of there. I always get compliments on my braids and they are so neat. Even when they are old they still look good. Keep up the good work ladies. I'll be calling to make another appointment soon.

I got microbraids done by Sarah in April 2013, and they have held up great. Sarah and her assistant were fast. My service was complete in 4 hours and I have really thick , natural hair! I would definitely go back.
