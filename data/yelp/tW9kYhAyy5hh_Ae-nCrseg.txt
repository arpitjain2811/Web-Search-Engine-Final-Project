Love this thrift shop! I'm so glad they have found a new location on the southeast side of town and I can find great finds again and great deals!

Well organized, well priced, lots of variety and friendly employees. Merchandise is clean with lots of contemporary stuff. Good place to score a bargain.

Cool thrift store , very well organized and nicely displayed items , also didn't really have that musty thrift store smell ! Unfortunately there was really nothing there that I wanted , but I will definitely check it out next time in the area .
