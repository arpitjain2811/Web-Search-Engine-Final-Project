I've decided I will not let any other place touch my hair. Manny's is amazing. I always get a KILLER awesome haircut, and the price is reasonable too. The location has changed since this entry was made... Manny's has moved to a much bigger, nicer location at: 811 W. University Dr. 101 Mesa, 85201. Phone number is still the same - (480) 464-4403  Manny and Blanca do GREAT work, along with the rest of the staff!

there's so much wrong with the service in this place. Sometimes you get a good cut, sometimes you don't.   If you ask for a shave, you'll probably get hot lather and disposable razor raking across your face.  I know from experience.  I won't do that again. I gave this place enough chances. The older lady that doesn't speak any english is getting better at cutting hair though.

Great place to go! you must get the right person though... Ask for Manny or Blanca they are both great. My husband refuses to go anywhere else!!! There is an older lady that has blond hair that does not speak English, If you don't speak Spanish DO NOT GO TO HER. She doesn't understand what you want unless you point to a picture.

I've been coming to Manny's since I moved to AZ about 3 years ago. The cuts are consistently good, I don't have to wait long, and the price is good. Even when I've had to use hand signals to communicate since I don't speak a word of Spanish, it's like the lady read my mind since I still got what I wanted.
