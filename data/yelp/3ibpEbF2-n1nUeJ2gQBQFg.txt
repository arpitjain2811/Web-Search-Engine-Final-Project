Its got good food, but its rarely really clean.  Enjoy the plaque in the entrance that notes this place for having the fewest sanitation violations...

Ever been to a Denny's at 5:30AM on a Thursday?   I have.  It's strange.  Whether it's the long road trucker loading up on coffee, the random lady sleeping a booth, or creepy guy giving me creepy eye from a couple of booths over, the atmosphere strikes you as a little off. But hey, it's Denny's.  What do you expect?  For the food, well, again, it's Denny's.  It's not horrible.  Breakfast options are common, plentiful, and delicious.  The coffee will be topped off regularly and you'll be 6 cups in before you know it.   The rest of the offerings are typically anything from deep-fried somethingorother to a "fit menu" offering that usually is a little short on taste. So it's not a bad place.  It's a good place for kids, and you won't leave disappointed.  Just so long as creepy guy isn't there.

I only hit this place for a very early breakfast. The service is always good. The food is comfort style: too much cheese, salt, and grease. It's fine every now and then but not a regular place for me to hit.  Dining room is clean and somewhat modern.
