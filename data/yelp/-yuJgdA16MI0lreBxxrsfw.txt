Such a wonderful and welcoming church! I have been going for over two years now without going to a prior church.  I am a Believer now and for myself and my family I am so grateful for CCV Scottsdale. Children's ministry is amazingly. I have two boys 6 year old and 15 month old. The 6 year old told me all about how Jesus died on cross but they're fooled because he was resurrected. Brought tears to my eyes to hear him tell the story.   Look forward to serving (in daycare) and attending service every Sunday. Plus the music is Amazing!!!!!!!!
