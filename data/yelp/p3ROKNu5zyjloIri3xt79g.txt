I just don't like Baja any more. When I was in high school we would come all the time. I got the chicken burrito and it was just OK. Way more tortilla than filling. It came with chips and I got a large refillable cup but they only have the nasty golden peak cartridge tea. Why can't people stick to good ole fresh brewed.. The staff was super nice both when they took my order and I let them know they were out of ice..for 10$ my meal was just ok..
