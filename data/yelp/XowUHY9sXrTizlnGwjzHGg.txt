I couldn't find this anywhere on here so I decided to add it myself.  Tammy is totally awesome!  She knows what she is doing w/massage.  Her skills are amazing and she makes one feel so comfortable.  Pricing is reasonable, location is good.  Go there and try it.  You won't go wrong.

Tammy is an amazing massage therapist and I highly recommend her to everyone.  One of the best massages I have ever had.  She is also a fabulous person with a gentle spirit.  This makes the experience with her one of the best you will have.

I have been getting massages here for over a year and Tammy always finds the spots to ease the pain.  I like the use of warm towels too.  Give her a call.  If you are dealing with pain she can help you out.

Excellent massage! I booked 90 minutes while I was in town for spring training. I found Tammy to have an excellent personality, the massage to be firm and relaxing, and the price to be very reasonable. I'll definitely book again next year!
