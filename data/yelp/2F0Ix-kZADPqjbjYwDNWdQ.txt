This is the best Subway in the area - hands down. The location has ample parking, is clean, and rarely too busy. Even durring the lunch rush, this place is efficient. Never do I crave a Subway, but when I want fast food & still desire to "eat fresh" this is my spot.  Located in the Whole Foods shopping center on the South-East corner of Ray & the 101.

the staff here is not enjoying their work. It feels too much like a factory assembly line here in here. SMILE PEOPLE ! Life's too short to be miserable.
