This place is so-so. Its got a lot of booths still available so hopefully they'll get them filled and be able to offer more things. there's a variety of things to choose from tho so thats a plus. It's typical, nothing really stood out for me so I can't get all excited. Same stuff you find at any other swap meet. Didn't find anything that interested me so I can't comment on their pricing.
