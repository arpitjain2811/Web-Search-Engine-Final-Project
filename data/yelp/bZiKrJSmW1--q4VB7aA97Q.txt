I just moved to Las Vegas from San Jose, CA, and I have spent the past 6 months trying to find a good burrito. I'm talking soft flour tortilla, well seasoned juicy meat, rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole; with salsa on the side. I am excited to say I have finally found it! The staff is super friendly, and the carne asada.... hot off the grill and seasoned perfectly - reminds me of the bay area all the way :)  The one thing that throws you off about this place - it's located inside the convenience store of the Arco gas station on the corner of Rancho & Craig - I took a chance and was so glad that I did :)

Delicious!  I've been to the one on Rainbow and 95 when it first opened. Fifth time visiting...So far so good, the nachos are BOMB! Lengua tacos are delicious. This place kind of reminds me of Roberto's excluding the oily part.  The price is reasonable just like any taco shop. Small but clean! Also they have a drive thru so if your lazy hello drive thru!

The breakfast Steak burrito....OMG, I loved it!  I've been there before for a burrito, but it didn't really tickle my tummy!  But the B-fast burrito I ordered Steak, no beans, was awsome!  The steak had so much flavor I was in AWWWWWWWWW    I'm glad I gave them another try!  I will now go back for some Nachos.....
