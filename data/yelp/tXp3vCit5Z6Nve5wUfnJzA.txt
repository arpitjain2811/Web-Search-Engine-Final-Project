I had a totally opposite experience than the reviewer below (curious g).  I thought the owners were trustworthy and genuine.  Didn't even charge for simple watch repair that took two seconds.  They always give honest advice and actually care about the customer.  Edward & Marsha have been in business for a long time.  Family owned & operated and the owners are always there.  Friendly neighborhood place.  A fun selection of unique jewelry too.  I would send people there again and again.

I dropped off my wedding ring to get it repaired, it had been cracked while I was working, and they repaired it the next day at a very reasonable price.
