My god, so much food... The first time we went here, we made the mistake of ordering starters + mains. I now know that was a mistake. The pizza-bread bruschetta was essentially a huge pizza piled high with tomatoes, balsamic, onions etc. Very delicious, but so much food (even for three adults). The speck-wrapped shrimps with orange sauce are amazing! Honestly, with the quantities they give you, you could definitely get away with only ordering a starter. Don't think that the quantity means you're sacrificing on quality though. Service is very friendly, and they'll give you advice if you're stuck over choices. Typical friendly Italian owner (I think) came over and checked on us personally.  The only thing that wasn't to my liking was the pizza I tried, but since I've only ordered it once I'll chalk it up to an off day for the chef. Definitely worth a try. Family-friendly too.
