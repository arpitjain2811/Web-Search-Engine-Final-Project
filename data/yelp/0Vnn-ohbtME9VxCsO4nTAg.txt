Very honest, competent staff. Would not go anywhere else. They always are fair and will try to save you money if possible.

This is the best place to take your car!  We drive an hour to get here.  The service is phenomenal!  If you do live in the area, they will give you a ride home and pick you up when you are done.  (I wished I still loved close but they are worth the drive) Their service is fairly quick but they still do a great job!  Every time, I get my bill I say, "Is that all?!"  Really, I sometimes WANT to pay more but they won't let me!  Where else can you say that?!  Never have I found more honest, word-working, kind people.  They don't need to hike up their prices because they have loyal happy customers. :)
