Standards of cleanliness, freshness of produce, and friendliness of staff can drastically change a customers perception of a chain restaurant or fast food joint. Subway tends to be a place I frequent when I want something filling, low in calories, and quick.  My go to is a veggie delite with all the vegetables, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper, and oregano on 9 grain honey wheat. Maybe I have trained my taste buds to light nothing else. A part of me is not complaining because my sandwich is packed with fresh ingredients and contains so many kicking flavors. I will not be complaining because a footlong will only set me back $5. SWEET!

Tried their 3" breakfast wrap with white eggs and it was soooo delish! I chose the Sweet Onion dressing, which I think really "made" the wrap unforgettable!
