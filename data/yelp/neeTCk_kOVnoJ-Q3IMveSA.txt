This was my first experience using Anna Ware for a haircut.  Anna did a fabulous job on my hair! I told her I wanted something low maintenance, pretty much wash and wear, which is exactly what I got (but a little extra effort and it looks great for a night on the town too!).  It's so hard to find a stylist that really listens to what you want and what fits in with your lifestyle but Anna is exactly that. I look forward to her taking care of my hair in the future.

Anna is very fun and very professional. My wife loves her hair color and I drive many miles across town just for a haircut. 5 stars Anna!
