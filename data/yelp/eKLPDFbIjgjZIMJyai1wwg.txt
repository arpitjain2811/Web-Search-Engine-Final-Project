No nonsense barber shop.  Plenty of periodicals, and you won't spend more than 10-15 minutes in the chair.  Discounts for military as well.  Your best bet is probably just to show up, there's no reason to call ahead.

This barber shop is fast, cheap, and has a very old school and quaint atmosphere.  Nice barber as well, nice to talk with. Great place for mens haircuts!  10 mins in chair, perfect clean cut, and great rates. Only $15

I have been "shopping" around for barbers that are locally owned and operated. I have found my new home to get my hair cuts. Wayne's is a small business and very laid back atmosphere. I certainly recommend anyone to visit this barber out for their next haircut and give him a try you won't be disappointed.
