Great doc. Our whole family has been going there for years.  Including some business associates.

Four Months ago must have been a bad day and it was my first visit so it had made a first impression so went the two stars. As of today I have a completely different respect for Dr.Loo and his staff. They have risen above the routine care and have taken great care of my situation. Prompt phone calls by the staff and Dr.Loo keeping me up to date. They say first impressions are very important but my mistake was not giving them another chance. After several visits Dr.Loo and Staff are worth 4+ Stars

I've been with Dr. Loo since 2000.  I love his personable manner.  I don't always get to see him as he is busy (also most of my appts are usually last minute illness appts).  His NPs are great and listen to my concerns.  I entrust the health concerns for my entire family to Dr. Loo and Premier Family Care.
