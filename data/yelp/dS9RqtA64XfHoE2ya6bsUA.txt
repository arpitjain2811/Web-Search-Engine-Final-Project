All business and easy to work with.  Called him to trim some palms.  Scheduled right away, did a fine job trimming the palms with clean up.  Don't be put off by his gruff nature.  He's a great guy but all business.  Recommend him highly.

Mike and his crew did an awesome job at removing a very large stump in front of our home. Mikes team laid out tarps to catch all the wood shavings, ground the stump, picked up the shavings, blew the area with great detail and removed the waste. "Git-R-Done" kinda guy. I recommend Mike and plan to refer him to our friends!
