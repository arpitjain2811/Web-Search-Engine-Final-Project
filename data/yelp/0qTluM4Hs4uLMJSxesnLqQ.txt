Dinkey Donkey is 2 doors over from the Bad Donkey. Dinkey Donkey is the Ice Cream and Breakfast Parlor connected to the Bad Donkey. Yummy ice cream & shakes scooped with a heavy hand! Breakfast is being served from this neon-lime green parlor.   Great coffee, perfect bagels,  great egg sanwiches. They have tracked down the Best Bagel in Phoenix Metro from a New York  bagelman recreating the magic daily (selling wholesale near Deer Valley airport)

Yummy ice cream (Cinnamon? Yes, please!) and the "dinky" size is just perfect for when you want to splurge on vacation but not go too crazy. Not sure we would have ever found it if someone had brought us there but so glad we did go!
