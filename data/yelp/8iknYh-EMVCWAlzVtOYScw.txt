Hope they keep this store if BN has any plans of closing more stores.  We used to come here to study; then it was to peruse after we started our professional careers.  Now, we come here as a family to pick out books for our toddler.  Good times!

Always has what I need, friendly staff.. Clean restrooms.. & a cool place to hang while deciding if the read or mag is worth it over a nice cup of coffee..

The customer service was lacking.  Other than that I love that it has a Starbucks and you can sip on some coffee while you read a good book

Barnes and Nobel is a Great Family Place to read and grab a cold drink. Barnes and Nobel is a good place for current titles. The staff is always helpful, friendly and courteous. As a member, I enjoy the special discounts and the great variety of "bargain books."  My visit's to Barnes and Nobel are always an adventure! I bring my nephew to Barnes and Nobel for family time.  We enjoy looking for books and reading. Barnes and Nobel is also a nice place to grab a quick bite and some coffee. Maybe get some work done or just some quite time to sit and read.
