I am a fairy picky guy for not being metro... Less than 10 people have ever styled my hair, ever!  Liaisons has a comfortable, stylish feel without being pretentious. Heather was my stylist... It would be hard for me to imagine anyone else styling my hair - mostly because her shampoo put me in another world. Well, that and because I love Heather's work. No nonsense, fun people, easy to find and a wonderful service experience. Thanks Liaisons (mostly, thanks Heather!) [end]

Just got treated to a FANTASTIC color and cut... with a neck and shoulder massage from an amazing team of stylists, husband and wife, Chet and Kelli Cessford! Their talents, professionalism mixed with funky chic and hot new trendy skills will start your summer off RIGHT! Highly recommended!

Amy is such a great hair stylist. Love the way she does color and extensions are flawless if you are ready to go long give her a call. I have enjoyed Amy's hair care for 7  or 8 years. She is Amazing!!!
