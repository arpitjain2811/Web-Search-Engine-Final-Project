don't bother... and make sure you don't go there at night.

Our group of four had a good time here.  It made the cut on all the main "dive bar" requirements.  Good selection of drinks at cheap prices, games, friendly tenders, and a diverse crowd.  We did leave just before 2am, and found a guy passed out on the sidewalk just outside the door, but hey, maybe he just had a long day?  Overall we would certainly go back.

This was our last stop during a night of dive cruising. I had never heard of Marino's before and would have drove right past if not for the neon Cocktails sign outside. The bartender was friendly and walked around the bar regularly to check if we needed a new drink. We enjoyed the shuffleboard table and darts while here. The bar was pretty empty for a Saturday night but all the better for us to spread out and do our thing.
