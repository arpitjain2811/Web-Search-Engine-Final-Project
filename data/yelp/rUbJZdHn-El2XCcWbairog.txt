Some of the worst customer service I've experienced in Las Vegas since moving here five years ago. Would never buy anything with workers who are as rude and impatient as they are at this place. I got a sense of that over the phone, but I thought maybe the guy was just having a bad day. It was the same rude uninterested service when I went into their shop. The shop is basically a warehouse with the garage door open. Looked more like a make shift store front. You can also search google and see that there are others with similar experiences with these guys.

Sure the guys there might be a bit brusque, but what you will get is a scooter at a good price, with no hidden charges, and people that WILL stand behind their product and honor a warranty.  To me thats as good as it gets.
