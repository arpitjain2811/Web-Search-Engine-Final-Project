Sheila and Tom took care of us with great service and with a very personal touch.  They cleaned out the storage of any dust and gave us tips to keep the dust out.  Great Service from great people!  I would recommend them to anyone.

Gilbert Road Self storage is the best!  Have had storage there for about 3 years.  I was able to move to larger storage units when needed and change whenever I wanted to.  Very helpful friendly service.  Look them up  for all your storage needs!
