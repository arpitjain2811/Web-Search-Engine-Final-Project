It's time to top off the tank before heading back to LA. The price on the sign showed $3.69 but when I get to the pump it's $3.64.  SWEET! One thing about Phoenix, you can drive 3-4 miles and gas prices from station to station may vary only a few cents, up to 3 or MAYBE 5 cents per gallon regardless of brand,  it's very consistant, unlike LA.    In LA I've driven a mile or two and see prices vary as much as 15 - 20 cents a gallon from one station to another! QT has a nice decent sized store with plenty of munchies, including REAL food like sandwichws, salads, etc, plus beverages and other snacks.   It's always been clean inside and the staff has always been nice.

The best convenience store around. I'll drive past 3 circle k stores just to go to a qt. They have everything you would want in a gas station. Giving 4 stars because their gas prices are usually higher than everywhere else.
