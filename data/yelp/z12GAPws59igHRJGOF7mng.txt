Well they gave us bacon instead of Canadian bacon. Bad start to new place.

Always friendly staff with hot bread sticks and pizza during busy times. I learned tonight this store treats their staff to an order of bread stick after their worked shift.  I don't know if this is all stores or just this location but great job franchise owner for taking care of the staff.

The pizzas are always ready on time. They have a special taste that my kids love. What I found out recently is that one topping is included in the $5.00 price!
