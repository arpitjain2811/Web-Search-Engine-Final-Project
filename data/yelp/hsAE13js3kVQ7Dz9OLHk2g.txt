I am writing this review purely from the perspective of staying at the MGM grand.  The back door of this place opens up to the West Wing door to the MGM.  If your staying at the MGM, West Wing or anywhere else there actually, this place can make for some great savings. Simplest case in point, on our recent stay, a 30oz bottle of water in the MGM gift shop was $4.00, and a 50oz bottle at the Grand Ave was $1.79.  They have a full range of beers, wines, spirits to go too.  While not cheap by yoru hometown standards, they are incredibly cheap by the hotel standards, for grab and go to take back to the room. They also have a great range of snacks, crappy souvenirs, and if memory serves sandwiches, hot dogs etc.

This is a huge souvenir shop next door to the MGM Grand Hotel.  The prices seemed comparable to other gift shops.  It has all of the typical souvenirs one would want:  Magnets, keychains, etc.
