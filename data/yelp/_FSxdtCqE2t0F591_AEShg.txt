Mark and his team at Auto Glass Perfection did a great job for me. I had about 5 small chips in my window and Mark suggested repair vs. replace. I thought "what the heck, if that's what you think", not realizing he was saving me a ton of dough and making my windshield perfect. I appreciate his integrity and follow thru and will happily refer business when given the opportunity. Thanks for your help Mark!

AG Perfection is an amazing company.  We had a crack in our windshield, so we called AG Perfection to see if they could help us out with this.  Mark was very friendly and helpful, answering all the questions I had.  I will call AG Perfection for any of my auto glass repairs!
