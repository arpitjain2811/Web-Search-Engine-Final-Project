The place is a bit hard to find in the back of the business park, BUT it is well worth the effort! I had the chicken cordon blu sandwich, and my friend had the lasagna. The place can get packed during the lunch and breakfast rush so try to hit them up in between if you can. You will walk away one happy camper I guarantee!

Reuben sandwich was a joke.  Guy was friendly.

Surprisingly good restaurant hidden in the courtyard of an office building. They serve classic cafe fare for breakfast and lunch - eggs, sandwiches, soups, salads, and such. The food is very affordable, with most meals below $7, and a good value for the money. The owners are very friendly and talkative, and the restaurant is usually uncrowded.  For guests staying at the Hilton, it's a two minute walk across the parking lot. Well worth the walk.
