WOW! Dunia is awesome!! i had the privilege of visiting the salon while on vacation in Phoenix and came across a groupon ad for the works facial! Better than the package itself which was a fabulous deal, the customer service was EXCELLENT! I even bought another deal for my sister!!! Would highly recommend this salon to anyone in Phoenix! :)

I found Dunia through a coupon site and I'm happy to say, she's a great find. She's in a medical office (which makes me happy), front desk is professional. She's on time, professional, does a great job. I don't like the fluffy pampering type of facial, I like to feel like I've had something done. So far, I've tried two IPLs and dermaplane. Highly recommend.

I bought 3 photo facials on living social with  Dunia.  I couldn't be more  pleased ,my skin looks great ! Dunia is so nice and really knows her skin care. She takes her time and makes you feel pampered. I highly recommend her ! Plus she runs specials all the time.
