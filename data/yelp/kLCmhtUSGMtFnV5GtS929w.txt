This is hands down the best green chili burro and tacos you can find. The flavor is absolutely unbeatable, the green chili burro is like nothing you have ever tasted before, it is a tastebuds dream, so much in just one bite. The tacos, both chicken and beef are just amazing, the crispy shell and the flavor of the meat is just heavenly.   Lito's is a must try, once will never be enough. The down side is it has limited seating about 6-10 people , so might be best to order and take it to go

This is the ultimate hole in the wall. If you can find it then you are in for a treat. The green chili burro is unreal. The tacos are legit! Also, make it a point to check out the specials board before you order, they always have some great deals on there. For whatever reason it is easy to miss.  Skip all the -tos restaurants and get here. You will not be disappointed.

So far, so good. I was told by a friend to get a green chili burrito from Lito's months ago and finally found myself there for lunch. I was not disappointed and am anxious to try something else. Sorry Federico's.
