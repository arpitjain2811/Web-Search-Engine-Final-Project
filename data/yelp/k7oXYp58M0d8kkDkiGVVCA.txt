This place is awesome!! Beautiful girls, exceptional service and a full fledged party every time I've gone. I've been 3 times and plan to go many more.

I live in the area so was excited to see this club open up. I think I'll continue driving a bit farther to go to my other fav strip club. Security was a little over the top and I was distracted by them more than the girls. 10 cover I guess is ok. I pay 10 at HL and that place is much better. They did have a good dj and sound system. The service was non stop which was good and bad I suppose. Half empty glass and they were swarming to refill it. Overall, nice place but would rather spend money at other clubs.
