I was working with a gentleman named Robin looking to sell some tickets to an upcoming show.  Robin made me an offer that I thought was fair and I accepted the offer.  When I called back to let him know I was on my way he informed me that they were no longer going to be able to take the tickets.  I have spent money with this company before and thought they were a reputable place with ethics to buy tickets.  I guess I was wrong.  i will no longer do business with Robin or anyone else at Ticket Lobster and I highly reccomend looking elsewhere to spend your hard earned money.

I have bought and sold tickets with this company for many years and highly recommend them to anyone! Robin is always helpful on time and a pleasure to do business with. If he says he is going to do something he does it!! Highly recommended!
