Well, let me get the obvious out of the way: this is a sandwich shop inside a gas station. Yeah, that seems kinda shady, but don't be so quick to dismiss Roy's!  The bread is good (it comes from Great Buns - yay for delicious and double yay for supporting a local bakery!). The meat and cheese are good, although they pretty much just have the usuals (ham, salami, turkey, roast beef, tuna, I think).  There's a good selection of veggie toppings.  The sandwiches are fresh made as you order.  There's an excellent selection of fountain drinks (duh).  Service is friendly and quick. Prices are awesome! $4.99 for a sandwich, bag of chips, and a drink. There is a small seating area inside if you need a break, but it's probably much more enjoyable to eat at home.  Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Roy's, but it's definitely a solid sandwich option if you're in the area.
