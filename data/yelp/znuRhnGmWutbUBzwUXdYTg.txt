If your looking for someone who knows how to do long thick hair, Heather is your girl!  She has the experience to do all types of hair, just saw her recently cut short hair and it looks fabulous!!  All I have to say is I LOVE MY HAIR and if you want to love your new hair cut and style like I do mine then book a date with Heather Galwey at Steven Paul Salon.
