What can make a person like one gas center over another? It is not the intoxicating scents from the fuel that's for sure. It is simple for me, it close to home and I can go late night or early morning when no one else is there since it is automated. I for some reason like being the only one pumping.

Gas was $.40 a gallon cheaper than in CA for that alone I will be back there.
