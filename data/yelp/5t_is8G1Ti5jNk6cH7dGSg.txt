The employees are usually helpful and efficient. However, is it a good idea to toss raw chicken into the same bag as produce, ice cream products, and gum?  According to this Bashas staff, it's A-OK, and has been for a year.  Salmo-what?

Overpriced goods but the staff is nice. SRP pay center in this store is handy.
