This is the only station that my work tollerates. They  play just about everything (minus rap, yodeling, bluegrass...etc).  Chad the Intern is a cool dude... Unlike the other radio stations, I've  won concert tickets!  woohoo!

This station used to be everything the other reviewers have said, a mix station devoid of annoying DJ banter. It is now a Republican talk radio station with Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck (I think) among others. I am deeply disappointed.

Screw 100.5! I don't care if they bring back Jack or not...I will always hold a grudge against them for hosting right wing radical shows.....
