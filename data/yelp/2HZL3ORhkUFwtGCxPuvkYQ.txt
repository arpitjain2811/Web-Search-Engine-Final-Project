Now O'Reilly Auto Parts, but still the same great service as before.  This store is one of the best converts from Checker to O'Reilly -- their service is 100% outta here.  I needed a new battery, and they came outside, checked my old one, took it out, replaced it with a new one -- in 108 degree heat.  Hey, I am woman hear me roar -- but I gotta tell you that you cannot beat their curb service.  These guys rock!

I bought a temperature sensor for my 97 Jeep Grand Cherokee but when I got home and looked thru tool box I had no 1/2 inch deep socket. I called O'Reilly Auto Parts and I asked them if they loan out tools and they said sure. They saved me money by not having to buy something I may never need again. Thanks guys!!
