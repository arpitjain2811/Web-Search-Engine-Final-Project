Same day appointment, all the paperwork completed online before I even stepped foot in the door. The price was great for the exam. The girls at the reception desk were both awesome and very friendly. Very good experience!

The Dr that saw me was awesome, I would recommend this place to anyone. When I first got there I was immediately greeted, got to filling out my paperwork, and before I knew it, I was ready for my appointment.

I have never had an eye test before, so I didn't know what to expect.  The girl who checked me in and did all the tests was very nice, patient and helpful.  The doctor was thorough and made sure to answer all of my questions, which was really appreciated.
