Pretty good, I really liked the chicken salad, a lot if flavor, but the service isn't too great. They aren't that friendly, but the service isn't too great.

I saw this place and decided to stop by here with my luggage before i flew out. Best chicken i had in my life when i was at the airport.  The last person i met worked there, She's cool and we still keep in contact. Thanks for the Friend and Awesome chicken strips. Note- The Grandma sauce that I did not want accidentally spilled on my chicken when going to the airport. That was the best thing to happen to them. Heading back to vegas again just for the strips.
