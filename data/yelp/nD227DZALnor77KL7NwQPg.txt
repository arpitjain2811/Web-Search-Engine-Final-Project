I've participated two team building workshops with the Hunkapi staff, and both times I was seriously blown away. I've done a lot of other team-building exercises, and they are enjoyable but not particularly helpful. This was completely different. Terra's insightful questions and direct observations took the experience to whole different level. It was also a blast!! To be more specific, it took me four years of therapy to realize that I struggle between two selves--a strong, empowered self and a accommodating, intimidated self. With the horses, this conflict became apparent right away, and I actually had the opportunity to practice overcoming my fear and being more assertive and in command of myself and my surroundings. When I got back home, I saw an immediate difference in my interactions with my family, my clients, and my friends. What an invaluable experience!

Terra and the staff are unbelievable. Hands down the best therapeutic program around. My autistic granddaughter has been going here for over 3 years and the progress has been fantastic.   I do not hesitate to recommend them to whomever will listen.
