Wide range of reading material for all ages as you'd expect. Lots of periodicals to peruse. CDs available to borrow. Internet access. Regular storytimes for wee ones and Bookstart rhymetimes for very wee ones. Friendly, helpful staff.

Nice selection of books and an awsome local history section. Helpful staff know their way around the stacks.
