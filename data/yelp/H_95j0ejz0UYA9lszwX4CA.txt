This shop offers a fairly broad range of instruments which means that so long as what you're after is no bigger than a cello, there is a good chance you might find it here. As for the items themselves, I'll focus on their guitars because it's the area I know and themes generally run true through a shop like this.  The first thing to notice, and this is from someone with a fairly broad knowledge of guitar makes, is a slightly disappointing lack of well known brands which is a bit of a common theme through the shop.  This does make it difficult to tell how good an item is and indeed the only way to be sure is to play them and see how they feel.  Generally the pricing is fairly reasonable, but try to bring someone who can tell what is and what isn't a quality item to help you try them out. Where this shop does stand out a bit is with its rental system.  It's a fairly complicated system so I'll leave the person who devised it to explain it to you, but in short you can rent for 4 months and then buy at a discounted price.  This might seem a bad idea, but considering how many people give up learning an instrument within 4 months, this might be a good way to save a lot of money.
