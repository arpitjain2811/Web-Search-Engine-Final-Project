I am always happy to support LGBT owned and operated establishments, and I am an avid hookah fan so I was glad to see Blow open. It is a little hidden, but in a great location for those who live in South Vegas and/or Henderson. The service here was exceptional. The staff were incredibly attentive and friendly, honestly the best service I've ever had at a hookah lounge.  The hookah was great, and the staff were constantly circulating to change coals. Reasonably priced considering other hookah lounges in the city.  Drinks were also great, but I think a little overpriced. My glass of sangria (which was pretty small) was 10 dollars. It was great tasting, but a little pricey. Music was also great! Good mix of hip-hop, top 40 and EDM.  There was a weird movie playing (from the HBO channel) that was kind of distracting. It didn't really seem to mix with the atmosphere very well. Music videos or something else would probably be more appropriate.  Look forward to returning soon!
