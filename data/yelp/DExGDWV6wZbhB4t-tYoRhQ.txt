Listening to a local radio station and heard about this store.  Found it, met owner Frank, and ordered some shoyu poke and poi.  Frank made a fresh batch of poke that was seasoned slightly different than I'm used to, but it was Ono!  Looking forward to stopping by again when I am in the neighborhood!  Mahalo Frank.
