I had just started my Production Company and needed some photos to post on my website.  Yaer not only provided a photo shoot but also got some great candid photos from our rehearsal.  The pictures were so great that I have hired him for my last 2 productions as well. He has such a beautiful eye and captures things that are unexpected.  A big thank you to YB Photography.  You rock!

My wife and I wanted photos of our daughter, Yaer showed up prepared with all his gear ready to for action, he ended up getting some great shots. He even snapped some of our dog that we ended up choosing as well. We would definitely use him again!

One of the most important aspects of a photographer is the ability to see what others cannot.  The ability to see what makes a great shot and to have the skill to carry it out. Yaer has that and then some.  Excellent work!  He takes immense pride in what he does and it shows. I would highly recommend him for any photographic project you may have.
