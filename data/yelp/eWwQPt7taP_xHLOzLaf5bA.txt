We've been coming here for a couple years.   It's clean, the staff knows us here. I noticed they did some remodeling, and it's for the best.  I was here to use my $10 dining credit and our server was Nicole. She's really nice and I always know we're in good hands if she's our server. This is a great family run business and to my surprise I don't think I've ever ordered a desert here. Today was the day, I and a friend both got the Chocolate Bunt cake. It was served hot, and delicious but I honestly couldn't finish it.
