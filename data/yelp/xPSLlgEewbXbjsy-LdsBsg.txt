This place is really not too shabby! I almost feel bad only giving 3 stars, but it's nothing to write home about. It's just terribly convenient, given that I work next door. The staff is friendly. They've got ginormous breakfast croissants. They have spicy ramen noodles which are actually very tasty, and they actually manage to make them a bit spicy! Bundle that all up and add a bow of very decent prices, and I call this place a win. I've been finding myself there a good few times recently. Matter of fact, just yesterday I had both lunch and breakfast over there!

This place is fantastic! I have been to Lucy's twice now and I have been pleased with my meals. The first time I stopped by I ordered a sandwich and it was delicious. There are just too many chain restaurants around the valley, so I love to try something new. I will be a frequent customer!

I have lunch here all the time. Staff is really friendly, always gets my order right, and remembers me. If you're looking for Asian food, they do it really well here. they use quality ingredients. No fast food kind of ingredients here. The salads always fresh and the chicken and rice are always cooked right.  The restaurant is clean and cool inside, and the people are really nice. Just a really welcoming environment.
