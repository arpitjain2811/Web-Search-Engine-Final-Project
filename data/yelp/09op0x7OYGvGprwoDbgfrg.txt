Rude employees. Awful company. Waste of time, money, energy.

I went in because my account was negative $300 and I was not the one who did it.  I was pointed to a banker Joey who was amazing.  He talked to the fraud department for me set up my new bank account and made everything smooth and payment.  They were even able to get me my stolen money back using the banks fraud insurance thing.  Def glad that I had Chase.

Earlier today, the teller gave me money  so I left the bank swiftly, like  Spiderman eating a peanut butter sandwich living happily ever after, the rest of my day.
