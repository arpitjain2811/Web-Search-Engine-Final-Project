I went on a Friday for Reno's Roc n Sol All-Stars JAM. The jam host,  Reno Renaldo Bellamy, was friendly & professional. He greeted me as I walked in & made sure I was signed up to play bass & sing. The house band & jammers were great & supportive. I was not charged for my sodas & the drinks are cheap. The food was excellent. I will be back!

Saturday nights are very chill! Live house band at 9 and then a cover jam band comes on about 10:30. Affordable drinks with live entertainment - always a good time. The bartenders are quick and take care of everyone!
