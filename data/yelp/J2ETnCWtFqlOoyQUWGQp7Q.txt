Seems to be a dying breed. The store next to my house closed so this is "my" new Blockbuster. AT LEAST IT IS STILL OPEN. I hate going to red box and don't have the energy to figure out how to use my PS3 to stream movies. Service is always good and folks are nice. Not much more to say than that.

I don't know where I've been. I thought these were all closed. Nothing is better than a stroll through the movie rental store. Way better than red box huge selection of titles that I would never have realized  were available. I will definately come back!
