Super ghetto. Had a verbal altercation with a man who had a very heavy european accent- could've been russian or something, maybe. I'm a very easy going person, and I have a patient demeanor and this man was trying to school me on communication- I don't think so. Sorry, not the silent meek subservient asian you think me to be. Never went back- sour memories.

A bit of a rundown location but its close to home and a lifesaver for school supplies and some home necessities.

Never met a bargain I didn't Like.    Whatever you are looking for,  need it not. Chances are this place will have it or some incarnation of it.
