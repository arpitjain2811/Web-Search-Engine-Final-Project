tons and tons of esoteric bulbs.  why do they exist?  why would anyone dream of that strange looking bulb?  who knows!  but they've got em!  and they are very friendly and helpful.

Problem: 4 obscure lightbulbs for bathroom have blown out over 2 years.  Hypothetical solution: these guys Result: they were very polite, found the bulb in 90 seconds and had me out of the store in 3 minutes. Got 6 bulbs for 24 bucks Conclusion: great specialty store... I'll use them again at some point.

Hey, I have one of those Conair Vanity mirrors that has a light around the mirror, last time the bulb went out I had to order on line, it took at least a week to get a replacement and cost over $5.00 plus postage for one bulb to replace it, this time I found the Light Bulb Store and they had just what I needed, and I was back in business in no time, great service, nice friendly people,  and the bulbs were a couple of dollars for two.   Thanks!!!
