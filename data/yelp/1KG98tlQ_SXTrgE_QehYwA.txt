This is a great little bar with great food, 2 pool tables, televised sports and gaming. 3 Happy Hours a day and ample seating make it affordable.  Bartenders are friendly and sociable. They have Bike Nights on the first and third Fridays of the month starting  January 17th 2014. If you want a affordable and enjoyable night out, this is the place!!!!

Came here on a Saturday night for karaoke with Kid Vegas. Good song selection, sound's a bit sketchy but not the worst. Not much in the way of beer, but they do have Amber Bock!  Bar tenders were attentive and courteous.  Beer pong and pool tables, good size bar with decent amount of machines.  Young crowd with great energy and a really fun vibe without any craziness.  I had a good time.
