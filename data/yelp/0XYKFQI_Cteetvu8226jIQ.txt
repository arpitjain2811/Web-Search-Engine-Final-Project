Meh. I appreciate the town preserving a piece of old west history, but it's not the most interesting roadside attraction. I would recommend stopping by if you're in the area but I wouldn't make a special trip for it.

What a lovely little surprise to find just next door to an ice cream shop in Wickenburg, AZ. Not knowing much about the town at all, I appreciated this little hidden gem as it helped me learn more about the town and its rough Wild West history. If you're driving through the area, definitely stop through and check out this little square where prisoners used to be on display for punishment before they had an official jail in town.
