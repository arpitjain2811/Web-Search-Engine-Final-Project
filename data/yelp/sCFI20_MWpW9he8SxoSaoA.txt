Not very impressive on first view, but clean, comfortable and reasonably priced.  We stayed there three nights and would recommend it. The "Continental Breakfast" was a joke - not-too-fresh bagels with cream cheese and jellies, weak coffee and a nice choice of teas and hot chocolate.   Other than that, not bad at all - especially for Gila Bend.

The front desk receptionist Rere rocks!  This place was a fantastic place to stay, she made us smile and laugh and I highly recommend a stay here.  The place is not new so get over it, the rooms are spacious and there were 4 adults in our group.  The continental breakfast was one of the best, I even asked for the breakfast burrito recipe.  It was a great place to stay, clean rooms and courteous staff.
