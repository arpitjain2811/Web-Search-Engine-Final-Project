I LOVE Pilates Central! They offer multiple classes that are very accommodating to my schedule (working, single mom) I have never taken Barre classes until I tried them at Pilates Central, and now I am there every week! Britney is my teacher and she is GREAT!! Highly recommend

Vanessa is an accomplished trainer and a life-learner who found her calling in the Pilates method. Funny and warm, she makes the experience - whether class or private session - fly by. Yet there is no doubt at the end of the hour that one's entire body has just been put through a hard workout. She seeks out additional training, seminars, and methods to constantly better herself and ensure she is challenging and supporting her clients. The studio is a spa-like environment that allows you to slip away from your day for a little while, and it is always spotlessly clean. I leave each session feeling taller, thinner, calmer, and stronger.
