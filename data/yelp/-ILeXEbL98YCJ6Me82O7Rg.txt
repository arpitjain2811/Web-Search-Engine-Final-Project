The food is ok(for Mcdonalds), but the service is some of the worst I have ever received at any Mcdonalds, They are also out of everything, and I have been ignored the two times I have been in there, Horrible service.  Hopefully this is due to being a new store and they work some of this out.

Friendly staff. I miss McDonalds. Stupid diet. I snuck in and had a double cheeseburger. Don't tell my wife.

This "new" location is worse than the one that closed down, down the street. The other day I asked for a McCrib & the drive thru attendant went on and on about how they don't have it till next week & that it isn't real meat & it doesn't have real BBQ sauce & questioned me why I would want that sandwich to begin with! I came back the next day & a different drive thru attendant was equally rude! If I could, I would give them zero stars.

Fairly new building so modern with plenty of room. Lots of windows so lots of light. Kept clean.
