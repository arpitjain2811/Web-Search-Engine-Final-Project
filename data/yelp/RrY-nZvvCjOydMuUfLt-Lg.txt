Very patient and nice. Some of their jewelry is affordable for the common person. I bought my girlfriend a necklace, a ring, and earrings there. Each time, I had great customer service.

Very welcoming, warm and patient. Always with a smile and helpful. Keeps you informed on the updates and try their best to get what you want. Loved it and would prefer always shopping with them first!

I unfortunately purchased my fianc√©'a engagement ring here 6 months ago. I have had to send it for repair 3 times. There is a woman who works there with a very heavy accent who should never work in a position which is customer facing. She is rude, accusatory and unhelpful. This situation alone was bad enough. I didn't need to horrible service too.

This location hates to do returns of their merchandise. Purchased from their online site, had original receipt. Customer service was terrible and they tried to refund less than what I actually paid for the merchandise.  Additionally they made me wait 30 minutes for a manager to try and help me out.
