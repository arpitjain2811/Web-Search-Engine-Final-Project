Had a great experience!  Not the usual contractors that work half day and go missing at times (at least that has been my experience).  They showed up and knocked out my kitchen, hallway and bathroom quickly.  Everything looks amazing.  I would highly recommend these guys.

Friends don't let friends have ugly floors is a funny enough tagline, but these guys lived up to it. I met with Barry, a dedicated pro that is as knowledgeable about his product as he is funny. And the installers are skilled, not just hired hands. Give RNB Flooring a call. You won't be sorry.

Our floors have never looked better! The quality and selection of materials is fantastic, allowing us to select the perfect carpet for our home. We love our new floors!
