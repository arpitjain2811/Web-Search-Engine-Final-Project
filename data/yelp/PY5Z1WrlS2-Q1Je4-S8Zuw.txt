This place is a restaurant of the chain pub variety. It's okay for that. The food is nothing to write home about. It does, however, have an indoor soft play that is cheap and large, though it is dark inside. It's a good place for a rainy afternoon in which you drink some generic cider and your kid wears him or herself out. There are certainly nicer restaurants nearby but the soft play is kind of a secret bargain.
