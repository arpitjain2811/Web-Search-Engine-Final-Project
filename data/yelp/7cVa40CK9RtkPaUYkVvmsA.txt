I went to Molli Cody's Hair Salon to follow a a hairdresser who moved there. Her name is Ali Knight! She is fantastic! She does great full, all over color, great blow-dry's and straightening, great with bangs, etc. She is excellent and so this salon deserves a great review! The prices are resonable and the job is first class! I always get compliments the minute I step out of the salon. I have thick curly/wavy hair and I change my color at the very least once or twice a year.

Molli is an absolutely caring and professional hair stylist. I visited her after having my hair destroyed at Socio Salon in Scottsdale and she took me into her salon last minute, the NIGHT before Thanksgiving. She was diligent, understanding and reasonably priced. If you are looking for a compassionate hairstylist that loves her job, you found it!
