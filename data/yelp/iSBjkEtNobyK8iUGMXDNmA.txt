Only popped in for a quick pint just before they called last orders but the range on offer seemed good, service was friendly and the feeling overall was one of it being a decent pub frequented by a local clientele. Worth making the trip to the eastern edge of town for.

Perfect size place with enough tables and chairs to not be too crowded.  Lot's of TVs for watching the games, no background music, staff was attentive.  Take a sign only credit card which is really nice for business trips... they have an average array of brews on tap, I didn't see any of the smaller brewery beers available.
