This firm is outstanding! They were beyond professional and everyone from the receptionist to the attorney made me feel that my case was important.

Chad's a real person - not a stereotypical attorney.  He's approachable, logical and compassionate, yet very tough when he needs to be.  A top-notch businessman, Chad is always looking out for his clients' financial well-being. I HIGHLY recommend the Dennie Law Offices to anyone needing legal advice!

I would like to share my experience with Mr. Dennie.  I assure you that if you are looking for an attorney, you will be best served by choosing him.  He is very knowledgeable in many areas of law and is compassionate, professional and caring about his client.  Chad makes sure that you feel at ease and all of your questions are handled.  The case he handled for me took several months and he  always made me feel comfortable and relaxed even in high stress courtrooms.  He is the best at what he does and I would send anyone who needs legal advice his way.
