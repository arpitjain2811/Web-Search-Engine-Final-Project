It's your typical CJ's. I've giving it two stars because they didn't include a Green Burrito. Shame on you.

This customer service is really bad and the food is just as crappy!! Stay away! I have gone there a couple of times and they just don't seem to get the order correct. Will not go back.

I love Carls over any other FF resturants in the the area. I like their $6 burger selection and Carls singles. The FF are good but wife like the cuts. Almost every time walking in the door we get a big holler, welcoming us to Carls if the people aren't helping someone. So, with the corners choice of Mc Donalds, sonic, jacks down the street, I choose Carls. Oh I looked at the other few reviews adn i would be upset at a sandwich that looked empty on one side but then I ask where is the other side. Probably not centered well. Oh and talk about little meat go to Subway. the italian sub is like ordering a vegie.
