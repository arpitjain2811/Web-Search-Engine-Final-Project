They will tell you your insurance company states you have not met your deductible, and will have you pay out of pocket... and if you do not you cannot be seen.  Then they will bill your insurance carrier, and get paid, and not reimburse you, unless you happen to call your insurance carrier and note they have been paid and call for reimbursement.  When you call for reimbursement, they will not apologize, and will treat you in a less than kind manner.  I guess getting caught double-dipping ticked them off.

Stopped by here with some strep throat. They were very quick, and the lady up front was very nice and accommodating. The Doctor was very helpful and he offered me many different options for medicines and treatments. I've also had other family members come to this location and they all enjoyed their experience.
