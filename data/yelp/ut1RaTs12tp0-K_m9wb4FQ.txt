So I was just going the farmers market and saw this place. It wasn't on yelp, so of course I had to add it. It was really late in the day, so the place was empty. I walked to browse and took some pictures of the product that I've uploaded. They have a decent variety, specially given the location. The server was super helpful and took her time to explain all the different deserts. Unfortunately the deserts were nothing special. They tasted like any other mediocre bakery desert and are not memorable. I tried the Egg tart, Coconut cupcake, and eclair which came out to around ~$5  Debit or cash only. Table service available

Great selection of pastries !

I like their Portuguese tarts, with sugary custard and chewy tart shells (instead of the eggy-tasting and flaky Hong Kong-styled ones). The price is not bad, but sometimes some items taste like they've been in the fridge for a bit too long.
