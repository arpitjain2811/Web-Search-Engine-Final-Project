Might be the cheapest / best retail store to pick up a new iPhone5 case this side of the Pacific. $9 for a clear rubber case (my phone is white) and a rainbow of other colors. They also have bumper-styles for $11-ish. Yes, you can order one on Amazon, but at least here you can see how the cases look / fit in person. A ton of iPhone4 cases, too, even cheaper.  Noticed a wall full of knock-off Toms (shoes) for under $20 if you're into that kind of thing!

So much potential here! Lots of space here. Someone hurry and rent some space, you got potential for growth! Theres a business in there that ships packages that I have never heard of the company. Wonder how much they charge. One thing for sure I loved the store in the corner with all the Chinese merchandize. I will visit here again and take pics!
