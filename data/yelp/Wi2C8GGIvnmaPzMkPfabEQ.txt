It's actually Salvadorean food.. The papusas here are delicious and if you go on Wednesdays, they are a dollar each if you buy 12 or more.. Which you will!! I recommend the papusas de revueltas, which have cheese, beans, and chicharron.. Don't forget the sauce!!

This was my first time trying pupusas. If you don't know what they are ...pupusas are made of corn and remind me of an empanada except it is flat like a pancake. I ate a pupusa that was stuffed with zucchini and cheese and it was delicious! It is great comfort food. They also had a pupusa with other types of meats (shrimp, pork, beef). I only had one pupusa but I was just in there for a snack and they are pretty decent sized...and very affordable. I think the one I had was around $2-$3 and the ones with meats were closer to $4-$6.
