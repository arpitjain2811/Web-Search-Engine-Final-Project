Normally I dont do carls jr. I find the food to be mediocre and a little more pricey compared to other options. I could go to chipotle for the same price. Well, today I felt like being different, especially since i got a coupon in the mail for a buy one get one free.  the cashier couldnt understand my order and when i got home i realized it was completely wrong. Very annoyed I called the manager and he was extremely nice. He explained that the cook just followed orders and the cashier took the order wrong. He apologized multiple times and asked what he could do, to make the situation better. he even offered to comp my meal if i wanted to come back then, or if i wanted to come back the next day he would fix the problems for free. Awesome! Its lovely to see customer service at its best, and even better when you get a coupon with it.
