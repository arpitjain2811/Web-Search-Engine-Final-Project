Photography is not work but an art, and Traci has mastered the art of capturing life's precious moments in photos. She has done pictures of my family (including my newborn baby and tiny little 4 legged baby) which were great. She is brings warmth, positivity, and a creative eye to each shoot which results in amazing pictures

Traci has an eye for capturing the most of what you will want in a session.  Her editing skills are impressive.  She took my daughters senior pictures and our family photos. I would recommend her to anyone! Thanks Traci for you professional work!
