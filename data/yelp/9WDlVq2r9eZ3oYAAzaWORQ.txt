REOPENED...new owner Dan ..Nice guy, knows nothing about how to run a business NOR FIX COMPUTERS!  His electricity is NOT turned on because they just bought the business and don't have the $$ for the deposit yet.  They work in the dark and then take your computer home.  I was quoted a price to repair and upgrade my computer.  It was NOT done as promised later that day nor 2 weeks later!  He had me pick it up at his house and still my computer was not upgraded and he lost my power cord and "rigged" one up for me with black tape...Still waiting for the upgraded memory card he promised and my new card that I have NEVER RECEIVED..PLEASE stay away from this place!  You are better throwing your laptop in the trash then taking it to this place!
