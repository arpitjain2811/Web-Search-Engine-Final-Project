When I have a chance to come to Las Vegas for vacationing I really enjoy shopping for my dog at Lush Puppy. It's hard to find clothes for my dog at other pet stores since she is about 75 lbs and a rottweiller & border collie mix.  But at Lush Puppy I always find cute tank shirts for her that fit. They have absolutely adorable items for your pets.  If  you are a dog or cat lover I do recommend to stop in this store and take a look for yourself. The customer service is nice and friendly.

Cute place but not much for my big dogs.  Everything seemed to be geared towards smaller dogs.  Not a big selection but what they did have was pretty cute.
