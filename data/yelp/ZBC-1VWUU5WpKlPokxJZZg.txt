Staff was friendly and nice when i came here and there was plenty of seating available.  Great quick meal while you wait for your oil change next door at jiffy lube.

I have been coming here for years. Probably at least 20 years. It's right around the corner from my parents' house. It's always clean and the employees are friendly.

Sometimes they have ice, sometimes they don't.  Some times the coke is actually diet coke and sometimes it isn't.
