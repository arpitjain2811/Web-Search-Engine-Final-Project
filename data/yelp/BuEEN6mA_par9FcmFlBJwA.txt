The other day I passed by this place and realized there was a new coffee shop in Tempe. I, of course, needed to try it as a part of my Coffee Tour of Phx! FTW!!! But it wasn't a win...sadly. A friend and I got coffee here tonight. The place is really kind of shady...it looks like it is out of business kinda... Once inside it kind of feels like you are in a creepy person's basement...it's very dark and there is a performance space of sorts in the back. The barista was nice and they have information about the coffee that they use, who is a local roaster, which would be nice if it was any good. I got a latte and my friend got a vanilla latte and it tasted somewhat sour....too bitter and acidic, I drank about 5 sips before giving up on it. I don't think I'll be back....sorry guys!!

I couldn't get to try the coffee without getting towed from their parking lot while going to the ATM across the street.  Coffee was ok but being charged $155 for a tow while getting money across the street on a very not busy Thursday night is just not worth even trying to go back.  Not ever going back for a $5 mediocre coffee.  They could have the best coffee in the world but too bad you can't park there.

Decent cup of coffee on one occasion, great cup of tea on another.

The Fixx is basically a front for a towing scam. Please don't patronize this business.
