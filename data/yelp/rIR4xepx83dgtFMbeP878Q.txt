I bought a couple of used tires from this place and one of my front tires split in 4 days. I called to ask if they would replace it since it had not been a week and I was told no. They said they would offer me a discount on another one.  I know that used tires are not guaranteed, but 4 days!!! come on....it was money wasted....I paid my stupid tax alright.

Been coming here for my tires for years and have always left satisfied. I've had work done on my car here also and have never had any problems after.  No matter the  budget, I always left with something. I have purchased used tires that lasted just as long as new ones. Customer service was great and there was always someone making sure you had what you needed!

Got some quick exhaust work done on my car. The work was top notch and they allowed me to ensure the alignment was exactly how I wanted it before the welding began. The price was more than fair. Looking forward to coming back in the future!
