J T has been doing my handyman work for about three years.  He is conscientiousness with the very best prices.  Fixed refrigerator ice maker,  sink disposal, water heater, ceiling fans, and more.  I am a a retired grandma and I am so happy I found him.  Before J T, I was overcharged for poor work.   Thank you J T.

J.T. installed a water softener for me recently, and did an immaculate job.  He has also installed a couple ceiling fans for us in the past.  His prices are always very fair, yet I don't have any problem paying for high-quality, honest, friendly service.  It's really nice to know a guy who can fix/install almost anything.  Keep his number handy!
