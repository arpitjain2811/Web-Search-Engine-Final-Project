Called them when my car overheated about 20 miles from my house.  AAA sent these guys.  I have no complaints- although the truck ride home was kinda stinky (but I don't expect much from work trucks) and the driver was SILENT!  Didn't even attempt small talk- just turned up his country station for the 20 minute drive.

Rescued my 1962 Skylark Convertible, and took excellent car and concern for it. Rick (the tow truck driver) was great! Glad to find a quick, courteous, tow company....Since I probably will be needed their services quite a bit with this beauty! Thanks Guys!
