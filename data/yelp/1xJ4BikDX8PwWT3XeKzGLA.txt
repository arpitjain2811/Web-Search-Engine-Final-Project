I don't care what any of you say. I like this crappy fake Japanese take out.  I've liked it since I was a teenager and nobody can convince me otherwise.  :-p

Hibachi is normally related to Japanese name. however, I notice all the Asian worker speak Northern CHINESE.  The place is very  clean - as expected - it is a new. the food: good selection, good salad bar, very reasonable price, fresh. it taste approximately equal to other Asian buffet. All good.

Good for fast food. Very similar to Panda Express with food choices and taste. Overall okay. Their potstickers are amazing though.
