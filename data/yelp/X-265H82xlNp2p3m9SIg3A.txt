There are a few times in life you might end up in Las Vegas. Turnt Up Tours was professional, friendly and hospitable. Highly recommend taking a ride if you want the full vegas experience. It's a constant party.

If you're not a Vegas regular I feel like the club scene can get overwhelming. Turnt Up Tours and the whole club tour/bus concept makes things so much easier. Getting ushered to the front of the club lines alone made it worthwhile. The party bus made it downright badass. The hosts were great; they made sure the ride between clubs was a blast and kept the drinks flowing. I highly recommend it!
