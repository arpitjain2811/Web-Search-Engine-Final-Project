I am majorly resistant to going to the dentist and have had some good ones and bad ones but I love Dr. Hendrickson's office.  The staff is extremely nice, and every trip from cleaning to a crown has been super FAST, easy, and pain free.  Awesome....

The staff is pleasant, but they seem to be more interested in making money off of patients than actually providing dental care.  My husband and I went in for our initial appointments and were charged $200 to have pictures taken of our teeth.  No other work was done, and none of the questions/concerns we had were addressed after bringing them to the dentist's attention.  Additionally, when we tried to schedule a teeth cleaning, we were told it would be a four month wait because they only have a hygienist there one day a week.  I understand being busy, but a four month wait for a standard cleaning?  That's a little ridiculous.

Hands down, the best dental office in town.

Dr. Hendrickson is great.  So is the hygentisit, Cindy.  I have my teeth cleaned every six months and have no problems getting in.  I have referred several people to his office and they all like him and the staff.  I never feel rushed when I'm there and I am seen at my appointment time.  I think one time I had to wait maybe five minutes.  I have been seeing him for over 5 years now.
