I've seen chiropractors most of my life, but none compare to Dr. Hedrix. She has incredible "bedside" manner and is very knowledgable without having to run a gazillion tests before she can help. She's also flexible with timing. I won't go anywhere else!

I am extremely blessed to find a chiropractor that cares AND listens. When I'm in pain she gets me right in. If I'm in tears she'll take the time to fully understand what's going on and really spend extra time trying to pin point my problem. I wouldn't go anywhere else for chiropractic care. I am without insurance and she is VERY reasonable.

You won't be disappointed.  No high pressure sales pitches, no contracts, just good, honest chiropractic care.  Always friendly, quick to accommodate and very affordable.  I just can't say enough good things about Dr. Hedrix and her staff.

I see Dr. Neil at this office. First time in 20 years of chiropractic care that a Dr. finally adjusted my upper neck area well. I feel 'unstuck' . Head moves more freely now. Looks and feels like a professional office. I'm glad we found our new chiropractor!
