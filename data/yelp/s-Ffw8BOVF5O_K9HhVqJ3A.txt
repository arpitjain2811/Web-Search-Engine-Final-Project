I love Taco Bell and probably eat here too much.  This is one of the best I have ever been to.  Service is super fast and everyone is really nice.  If you live on the west side, give this store a try.

I dont understand how taco bell is still in business in AZ where there are hundreds of great mexican restaurants. Taco bell is garbage!
