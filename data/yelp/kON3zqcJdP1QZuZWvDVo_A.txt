Fashion Square Food Court has a good representation of all the usual suspects. * Mexican food: Blue Burrito Grille.  Check! * Hamburgers: Five Guys.  Check! * Chinese Asian: Panda Express.  Check! * Upscale Caf√©: Paradise Bakery.  Check! * Middle Eastern/Greek: Pita Jungle.  Check! * Japanese Asian: Sarku.  Check! * Pizza:  Sbarro.  Check! * Subs: Subway.  Check! * Diner food: Johnny Rockets.  Check! I'm particularly fond of Johnny Rockets and Pita Jungle. They also have a few nearby Mall watering holes, such as:  * Kona Grill * Z Tejas Grill * Yard House * Modern Steak They're all pretty good, depending on what you're in the mood for eating and what game is on their big HDTVs.  BTW, the Happy Hours at Z Tejas and Kona are very good!

I only go here when I am craving a chicken stuffed Chile Relleno.  Let me tell you...IT IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER HAD!!!  Oh, I eat here at least every few months for the Chile Relleno.  :)  The last time I went to Z Tejas, I went to the patio with my sister where there were some flirts telling us how pretty we are.  If you like more of the social appeal, I would recommend the patio, but if you like more of a romantic or personal appeal, I would recommend eating inside the restaurant.
