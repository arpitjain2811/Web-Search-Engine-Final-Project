Candy Face Painting has been at several Yelp events and always seems to have a line of folks waiting to get colorful do-dads embellished on their cheeks . . . uh,. upper cheeks!  At Yelp Helps recently I received a big red swirly "Y" blazoned across my left cheek!

As a skeptical person, I watched Sheila paint other faces before I would let her paint mine. I was amazed, not only by the talent she had for her art, but the skill she had making even the most hyperactive children stay still long enough to paint their faces. Sheila knows her art incredibly well, but what impressed me most was her interactions with the kids and parents as well.
