Good price.. Clean water... Nice staff... Our canoe tipped over and we were rescued by their Emergency Resonse boat team.  haha. Even though i tipped it over on purpose in the middle of the lake, it was still very courteous of them to keep an eye out... I left my wallet, phone, and cash with the front desk, and I felt very comfortable leaving it with staff.  Not something i'd leave just anywhere. Thanks everyone there!

How great to have an affordable boat rental right by our home. And you can rent a pontoon boat!! Great lake. Great boat house with snacks, bathrooms. Excellent sailing instruction. Fun place.
