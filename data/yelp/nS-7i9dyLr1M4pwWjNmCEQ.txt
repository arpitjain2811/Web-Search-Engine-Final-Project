Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb...dumb, dumb, dumb, dum, dummmmmmmbbbbb. Waited in line for-ev-er cuz the sensor didn't pick up our truck. So, we proceeded to the window to place our order & had to tell the girl 3 times that we wanted a Mc-gridd-le, real slow like so they'd understand English, or so we hoped. But alas, it shan't be. They even had it correct on the receipt, but nay, I tell you, nay. The screwed it up afterall.

I think I gave this place 6 chances....SIX!  sounds ridiculous, I know.  I guess I suck at life.  I bet this place hasn't served a fresh chicken nugget in months... If by some act of God, they do happen to deliver some freshly-prepared delicious bits of saturated fat, they know what they have done, and they HATE you for it. If you're in phoenix or the surrounding areas, fast-food in the summertime is a hot-bed for food-borne illness.  Just look at the front page article in today's Arizona Republic.

Clean inside, seems to have been remodeled recently. Same mediocre service, average chain location.

Employees work incredibly hard to satisfy customer needs. They deserve more than minimum wage. Also, the cute brunette guy "Eric" I believe is a stud! Charming too!
