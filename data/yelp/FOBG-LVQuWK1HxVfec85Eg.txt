The Penny Black is renowned for its early opening hours and is usually frequented by workers just coming off of a night shift. However my friends and I believed that the early opening hours would be a perfect way to finish a good night on the town. We queued outside awaiting the 6am opening times joined by fellow likeminded club revellers fearing the impending hangover. There were a few shady looking characters, but despite a tough looking exterior they were more than happy to banter with us. The décor of the pub is quite poor and looks really run-down, but boasts reasonable prices at £3 for a pint of Foster's, not bad considering that they are one of the very few places in Edinburgh permitted to sell alcohol at that time. Personally I feel that a visit to The Penny Black is a must for everyone, simply to experience the novelty of being able to drink in the early hours, but after the first visit I can imagine the novelty wearing off.
