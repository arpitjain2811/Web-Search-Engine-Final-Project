Despite the name containing the word Panino, this is a Chinese restaurant that does not sell that type of sandwich.  What they do sell is cheap Chinese food at OK prices.  What I don't like is the fact that the food is really greasy and salty here... not my favourite place, but I do drop in when others in the group want to eat here. Standard items include the Shanghai Fried Noodle and the Spicy Eggplant.

Heard my order wrong...TWICE. First time I ordered Curry chicken, they gave me Kung Pao Chicken, I didn't accept the order and asked them to give me curry chicken, they just poured some curry over the kung pao chicken and gave it to me -.-  Second time I ordered Zha Jiang Mien (Noodle with pork, cucumber slices and sauce), I got Chicken Noodle soup, SERIOUSLY? Otherwise food is ok ad price is ok.

Cheap chinese food. Best bang for buck as you get a lot of quantity for what you pay especially the rice dishes. But it must be really cheap as they give you unlimited rice.
