These days, it can be a significant challenge locating a precision barber in this valley. When a gentleman requires 12-15 cuts per year, it's important to find consistency. Highly recommend the Glendale Barber Shop. Been in operation since the 1920's with more than 50 years experience amongst the barbers there.  Nice men's haircut with an excellent taper. 9am-6pm weekdays, including Mondays. 8am-4pm on Saturday. Remember: it pays to look well.

Came from out of town to get my haircut and a shave. Did an A+ job. Go here if you want quality.
