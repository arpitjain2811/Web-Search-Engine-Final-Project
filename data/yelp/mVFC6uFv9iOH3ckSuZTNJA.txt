I love all the girls who work here, Krissy is my beautician, she is the best!  I always make her cut my hair how she thinks it should look, I have yet to be disappointed! I would recommend anyone to her!

I received the best pedicure I've ever had in my entire life today with Maya! She has magic hands, she gives the best massages hands down! I had to start with that tidbit of information, but I also had a fantastic manicure and eyebrow wax.  Unlike most pedicures, where they give you the "obligatory" foot massage with the lotion, where they ruin it - asking if you want to pay more for 5 minutes instead of just letting you relax, Maya loves to make sure you have the best possible experience! She massages during the scrub, the lotion, and wherever she notices you are holding tension. She doesn't turn on a timer and watch it tick, she checks in with you to make sure you are doing okay and at the end of it your feet look and feel amazing! You might miss this place as it is tucked in a shopping center, but once you walk inside, it's an oasis of beauty and relaxation. Everyone who works there is really sweet and they just want to make sure you taken care of, it's kind of like the Cheers of nail salons, everyone knows everyone and if you are new, they will go out of their way to make sure you feel like it's your home too.

Got my hair do there today by Chelsea. She did an excellent job. She is great at color and highlights. Loved the way it turned out. Will be back for sure.
