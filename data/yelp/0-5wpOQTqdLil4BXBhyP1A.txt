It is a beautiful bar, separate non smoking dining room, and a cigar area with lots of tvs and cigars available to buy. Also they have Chicago brewing company beers on tap, very awsome!

When I lived in this part of town years ago, this was my regular spot.  Back then it was Skinny Dugan's Pub.  Stopped in this weekend.  Maybe my expectations are skewed, but it was terrible.  I didn't even finish my 1 drink and had to leave. It was clean enough.  Just dead, no crowd, no life, no interest from the bartender.  Guess I was hoping for more.

This was our  first time here. It was better than we expected.  The prices were reasonable.  We were here during happy hour so wine was only $4 per glass. Our food was good. We wish their menu was a little more extensive.  Our server was Jesse. He was very helpful & attentive to our needs.  Well definitely bank.
