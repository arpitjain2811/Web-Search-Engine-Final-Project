This place is G H E T O O !!!  Don't waste your time with this place.  Sure, there might be a deal here and there, but the quality is sacrificed big time.  The produce section is in horrible shape; most items are withered or even rotting.  Trust me, go somewhere else!

I gave this location such a low rating because the store is usually a mess. Having worked in supermarkets before I've noticed that products you think would be in the same aisle are in a completely irrelevant spot. Their shelves need to be reset in a better manner.
