I had purchased a Laptop from their Gilbert store.  Took it in to this store, because I had questions about operating the laptop.  My questions were answered quickly and correctly, and there was no charge.  A year later, the laptop got a severe virus.  Took it in, got diagnosis, was quoted a price for repairs.  Two days later I had the laptop back in operation.  These guys are pros, and honest.

Unfortunately, had to take my laptop in for spyware removal for the second time.  Once again, Data Doctors performed a complete repair/cleaning of the system.  Service is professional and knowledgeable.  Turn-around time amazing.   I trust these guys 100%.

Was quoted $59 + $99 labor for a $39 replacement keyboard. All I needed was one key replaced. Replacement key and retainer clip found elsewhere online new for $6.99 delivered.
