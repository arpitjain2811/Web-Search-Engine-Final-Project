Brea, Maggie, Diane and the whole gang are the best. I've been coming here for years and they always, always have a smile on their face in the morning.   When I visit a Starbucks, I look to see how friendly the folks are and how they handle the pressure if the place is packed.  Starbucks? Packed?  Nan.  Well, yes.  I also look to see if the remember my order from last time.   Well, these baristas rank up there with the best. Nice way to start the day!

Love the staff here. I don't even drink coffee and I am in there a few times a week.

I like this coffeehouse  as it is convenient to the house...and a short walk. Friendly baristas for the most part...some are more bubbly than others. Some remember your name, some don't. I look forward to the new pastry menu being rolled out within a few weeks in partnership with the recently acquired La Boulange from the bay area. I love their bistro boxes and the fact that many of their food items including pastries can be warmed up. It is a small store compared to others but they've got everything you need, including newspapers and complimentary wifi. They also have a lovely patio and it is even better when the misters are working.
