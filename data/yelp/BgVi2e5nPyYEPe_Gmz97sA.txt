Great price and great service. It's next day for most services without an extra charge.

I have since stopped going to this cleaners. This is nothing negative towards the employees that process the orders but the location that does the dry cleaning. On too many occasions now, my shirts have come back in less then stellar condition. They started coming with creases and broken buttons. I don't have the time to send shirts back to be repaired and pressed again. I would suggest finding another cleaner. And to the cleaners, it may be time to do some quality assurance at your factory.
