This is a great bar to watch football or any other sport for that matter, play darts, pool or just have a beer and hang out. The people there are friendly and it really does have a feel of a Phoenix "Cheers," where everybody knows your name.  There are pool and steel-tip dart leagues throughout the week and on Sundays it becomes Bears country, the favorite football team of the owners. They have drink specials and giveaways anytime the Bears score or win so it's a double-bonus for any Bears fan to come watch the game here.  Definitely the best Bears bar in Phoenix and the friendliest too.

Amazing Bears Bar with a true Chicago feel. Excellent bar selection and great service. The highlight is definitely the entertainment. Darts, pool, video games, and SO MANY TELEVISIONS! This is THE place to watch football.
