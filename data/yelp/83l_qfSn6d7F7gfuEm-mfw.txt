Best dental appointment for a deep cleaning ever! The staff at Gilbert Road Dental is fantastic! Friendly, kind, and they take the utmost care in making your experience a pleasant one.  I could not quit bragging to my co-workers, my friends, and FB about how amazing this dental group is. I enjoy the freedom to choose to watch TV or listen to my headphones while the work is done. All the equipment is sterile and very clean. The technician was attentive at all times to my comfort level. She was truly concerned with making sure that I felt no pain while completing the cleaning. Everyone is always so friendly at this dentistry and I always feel like family when I'm there. The excellent service did not cost an arm and a leg which is a huge plus! If you are going anywhere else you are missing out. Simply the best!

BEST DENTIST I HAVE EVER BEEN TO! I have always had a huge fear of going to the dentist due to some bad experiences and I have not had one single issue in the year I have been going to Dr Perkins! His office staff is amazing and I love my hygienist!
