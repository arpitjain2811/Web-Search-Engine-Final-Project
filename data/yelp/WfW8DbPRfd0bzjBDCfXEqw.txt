Rude welcoming by owner. Store was completely empty and owner yells from back of salon "what do u need". Walked out before giving a dime to a business that doesn't understand service

I had a great experience. I stopped in not really knowing what time it was, and they took me right away. I arrived before they even opened, oops. What great service to get me started to soak while they finished setting up. It's a little hidden in the strip mall, but clean, and affordable. Since this place is under new management there was a special for a manicure and pedicure for $30! Well worth it. I will be going back and am telling all my friends to go there too. I really liked that the owners asked me questions and got to know me. I felt like I was one of the family.  :)

This is the ONLY place I get my nails done because they style the best, most detailed work and are so incredibly caring. Tim and Kimmy are the sweetest ever and Kimmy consistently has a new type of polish or design to try! Gorgeous shades and designs to choose from and a huge variety of gel polish. Love them!!!!
