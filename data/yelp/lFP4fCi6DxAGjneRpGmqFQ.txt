This restaurant has style and the menu to suit but the atmosphere was lacking something with just made it feel a good place to eat and not a great place to eat, couldn't pin it down. The food was very good and a good wine selection, but not somewhere I would return too. 4-stars from me for quality of food and serive but I wouldn't be a retuning customer.
