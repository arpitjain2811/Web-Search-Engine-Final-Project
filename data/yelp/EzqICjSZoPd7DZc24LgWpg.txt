The prices are AMAZING!!! The clothes are all color coded, seriously you walk in and you see sections of all black fashion,white,red,blue,turqouise,pink,purple...etc!! things you could get at macy's or JCP are wayyyyy cheaper here and better quality as well! The shoes are set up the sameway and are total going out shoes! I believe they do military discount as well! When i head this way to town i usually hit both Fashion Q and Rainbow as well as ROSS!! A total shopping day! :) Oh also they have tons of cocktail dresses!! in tons of colors! just amazing!

Nice clothes and reasonable prices But i dont like trying stuff on bcuz there is absolutely NO privacy in fitting rooms. To try stuff on there's a room towards the back,entrance is covered with only two curtains.

This place is now called Rhapsodille. Cheap, good style, color coded, but fitting room is more a prison type experience...not that I've been to prison, but I'm sure it would be like this. Just a big room with mirrors and chairs....everyone tries on together...Yay. So make sure you wear your underwear! You're welcome. One of the young sales girls was not customer oriented in the least....too much attitude, but what do you expect when your buying a 15 dollar dress...take the good with the bad.
