I've never had a problem with the service at this location, in fact I much prefer it to the one in downtown Henderson (they aren't very helpful there).  I am always greeted and served quickly. The location is spacious, clean and professional.

If you are a merchant don't go to this bank. Their 'policy' is to take whoever walks in first. My question is, Why even have a merchant line at all, if you are going to treat everyone the same? However, it is a convenience we as business accounts pay for many times over. It may not sound like a big problem but when you go to the bank every day for your job and people who walked in after you are getting seen before you it makes your head spin. And that happens bc not all the tellers ask who was there first.
